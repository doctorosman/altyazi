1
00:00:00,426 --> 00:00:02,227
The Blacklist'te daha önce.

2
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:03,795
Oturabilir miyim?

3
00:00:03,864 --> 00:00:06,264
- Adım Anne.
- Raymond.

4
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:10,135
Bilemiyorum, Anne.
Hayatın oldukça dengeli görünüyor.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,667
Öyle olduğunu düşünmek güzel.

6
00:00:11,692 --> 00:00:13,392
- Sen ne iş yapıyorsun?
- Ben kaçağım.

7
00:00:13,674 --> 00:00:15,583
Bazı insanlar tehlikeli yaşamayı sever.

8
00:00:15,607 --> 00:00:16,906
Aklında ne var?

9
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,241
Senin bana yardım etmen.

10
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,109
Kız kardeşim için bir hediye bulmama...

11
00:00:20,185 --> 00:00:24,087
Eşi benzeri olmayan küçük, küçücük

12
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,482
ikimizin ancak sığacağı bir

13
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:27,950
çikolata dükkanı biliyorum.

14
00:00:28,178 --> 00:00:30,345
"North by Northwest"e ne dersin?

15
00:00:30,414 --> 00:00:32,847
Yarın, Village East'te
gece yarısı

16
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:34,349
gösteriminde oynayacak.

17
00:00:34,418 --> 00:00:37,986
Giriş kapısında seni bekliyor olacağım.

18
00:00:38,055 --> 00:00:39,254
Raymond?

19
00:00:39,323 --> 00:00:41,222
Anne, çok çok özür dilerim.

20
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,858
Bu gece gelemeyeceğim.

21
00:00:48,221 --> 00:00:49,754
Mallar üzerinde güçlü bir konumdasınız.

22
00:00:49,779 --> 00:00:51,079
Bakır, altın.

23
00:00:51,234 --> 00:00:53,101
Ama asıl karınız kripto parada oldu.

24
00:00:53,477 --> 00:00:56,711
Gördüğünüz gibi yılbaşından bugüne kadar
Bitcoin yüzde 800 kar getirdi.

25
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,707
Önemli bir konuma gelme konusundaki

26
00:00:58,775 --> 00:01:00,358
ısrarlarınız çok öngörülü oldu.

27
00:01:00,877 --> 00:01:03,378
Kazanmaktan sıkılacak
kadar zengin olmak güzel olmalı.

28
00:01:03,447 --> 00:01:06,081
Sıkılmış değilim.
Sadece gideceğimiz için huzursuzum.

29
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,582
Başka bir randevumuz var.

30
00:01:07,607 --> 00:01:09,373
Parasal durumumdan daha çok

31
00:01:09,398 --> 00:01:11,698
endişelendiğim bir randevum var.

32
00:01:11,723 --> 00:01:13,289
Geç kalıyoruz.

33
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,023
Briç hakkında ne biliyorsun?

34
00:01:15,092 --> 00:01:17,792
Oyun olan briçten bahsediyorum,
köprüden değil.

35
00:01:17,861 --> 00:01:20,428
Briç mi? Bilmiyorum.

36
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,430
Yatırımlarınızın ve varlıklarınızın

37
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,499
detaylı incelenmesi şu anki en önemli

38
00:01:24,568 --> 00:01:26,201
- konu değil mi?
- Evet.

39
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:28,636
Önümüzdeki birkaç ay içinde,
uygun kaynaklara olan

40
00:01:28,705 --> 00:01:31,239
ihtiyacımızın önemli ölçüde artmasını bekliyoruz.

41
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:32,741
Gördün işte.

42
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:35,744
Hepimizin farklı ilgi alanları
ve öncelikleri var, değil mi?

43
00:01:35,812 --> 00:01:38,713
Mesela, sabahları Bay Zuma
ticaret bölümüyle başlar

44
00:01:38,782 --> 00:01:40,882
ve sonra da spora geçer.

45
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,593
Bense karikatürlerle başlarım
ve koltukta uyuyakalırım.

46
00:01:43,653 --> 00:01:45,120
Gazeteyi okumak tüm günümü alır.

47
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,488
- Karikatürleri seviyorum.
- Yani...

48
00:01:46,556 --> 00:01:48,223
Karikatürleri de sever ama

49
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,291
ticaret ile arası çok iyidir.

50
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,494
Rakamlar, trendler falan. Gerisini biliyorsun.

51
00:01:52,562 --> 00:01:54,929
Oysa ben Bitcoin ile
metro jetonunu ayırt edemem.

52
00:01:54,998 --> 00:01:56,197
Ayırt etmene gerek yok.

53
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:58,500
Bitcoin elle tutulur bir şey değil.

54
00:01:59,936 --> 00:02:02,604
Öyle değil mi? Bilmiyorum.

55
00:02:02,672 --> 00:02:04,205
Bitcoin yatırımım

56
00:02:04,274 --> 00:02:06,207
ne öngörülü ne de çılgıncaydı.

57
00:02:06,276 --> 00:02:08,910
Sadece Bay Nakamoto'nun
talimatlarını dinliyordum.

58
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,545
Satoshi al dedi ben de aldım.

59
00:02:10,614 --> 00:02:12,814
Satoshi Nakamoto mu?
Onu tanıyor musunuz?

60
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,582
O... Gerçekten o mu?

61
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:16,317
Evet.
Dembe benden daha iyi tanıyor onu tabii.

62
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,685
O ikisi resmen...

63
00:02:17,754 --> 00:02:19,821
Görmemiz gereken
başka bir şey var mı?

64
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,322
Uçağa yetişmeliyiz.

65
00:02:21,347 --> 00:02:23,414
Evet, şey...

66
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:26,961
Singapur ve BSE'deki varlıklarınız...

67
00:02:26,986 --> 00:02:28,285
Pardon. Nakamoto'yu mu tanıyorsunuz?

68
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,665
Bildiğimiz Nakamoto.
Kimse Nakamoto'yla tanışmış olamaz.

69
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,534
Bay Cane, gerçekten gitmemiz gerek.

70
00:02:32,602 --> 00:02:34,402
Yani sizin de gitmeniz gerek.

71
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:36,704
Peki, tamam.
Size yardım edebileceğim başka bir konu varsa...

72
00:02:36,773 --> 00:02:38,273
İhale ya da koz döndürmeyi

73
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:40,500
bilmiyorsan yok.

74
00:02:41,278 --> 00:02:42,644
Briç.

75
00:02:42,712 --> 00:02:44,446
Hayır.

76
00:02:47,257 --> 00:02:49,684
Neden endişelendiğimi
söyleyeyim mi?

77
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:50,852
Townsend...

78
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:52,854
Kafam çok karıştı.

79
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:56,224
Ne kadar okusam
o kadar az anlıyorum bu oyunu.

80
00:02:56,293 --> 00:02:59,060
Orada seninle olmayacağım için bir de...

81
00:03:01,832 --> 00:03:03,248
Raymond, ben ciddiyim.

82
00:03:03,273 --> 00:03:05,173
Biliyorum. Seni bu yüzden seviyorum.

83
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:07,610
Ama bir sorun olmayacak.

84
00:03:08,638 --> 00:03:09,529
İyi olacağım.

85
00:03:09,753 --> 00:03:12,654
Tekrar yok. Bunu bana sen öğrettin.

86
00:03:13,043 --> 00:03:14,576
Düşmanlarının bir adım önünde

87
00:03:14,644 --> 00:03:17,479
olmak için ilk kural budur demiştin.

88
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:20,448
Bir şeyi bir kere yap. Fark edilmeyebilir.

89
00:03:20,473 --> 00:03:21,516
Belki iki kere...

90
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,219
Ama ondan sonra, tekrara düşersin.

91
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:26,705
Bu kaçıncı ziyaret olacak?

92
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,047
Beş.

93
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,029
Ondan hoşlanıyorum.

94
00:03:35,763 --> 00:03:38,399
Sığınacak bir yuvaya gelmeyi seviyorum.

95
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,535
Pencereden bir mum yandığını görmeyi...

96
00:03:40,604 --> 00:03:43,004
Beni karşılamayı bekleyen gülümseyen yüzü...

97
00:03:43,073 --> 00:03:46,174
Ben... Daha önce hiç sevmemiştim.

98
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,798
Şimdi seviyorum.

99
00:03:51,948 --> 00:03:56,217
Tennessee'nin sembolünün süsen çiçeği
olduğunu biliyor muydun?

100
00:03:56,286 --> 00:03:58,253
Kansas'ın sembol çiçeği hangisi?

101
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,871
Ayçiçeği.

102
00:04:00,457 --> 00:04:03,291
Süsen çiçekleriyle büyüdü. Onları seviyor.

103
00:04:03,547 --> 00:04:05,680
Seninle olmalıyım.

104
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:10,632
Sen, Raymond Reddington ile olmalısın.

105
00:04:11,902 --> 00:04:14,235
Ben Anne'in yanındayken kendim değilim.

106
00:04:14,304 --> 00:04:16,804
Olmak istediğin kişi olmayabilirsin

107
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,766
ama her zaman olduğun kişisin.

108
00:04:24,737 --> 00:04:26,337
Yaşayan en seksi adamı
yeterince bekledik.

109
00:04:26,455 --> 00:04:28,789
- Acele etme.
- Benim için

110
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,285
dakiklik önemlidir.

111
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,753
Belki uçağı rötar yapmıştır.

112
00:04:31,821 --> 00:04:33,321
O zaman neden şimdiye kadar aramadı?

113
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,790
Çünkü dramatik girişler yapmayı severim.

114
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,459
Raymond! Süsen çiçeği!

115
00:04:39,202 --> 00:04:41,329
Çok tatlısın.

116
00:04:41,398 --> 00:04:42,864
Uslu olacağına söz ver.

117
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:46,534
Ne diyorsun? Çok uysal biriyimdir.

118
00:04:47,126 --> 00:04:49,537
Şunları suya koyup sana sandviç yapayım.

119
00:04:49,606 --> 00:04:51,105
Bran ve Lois'i hatırlarsın.

120
00:04:51,174 --> 00:04:54,342
Evet, tabii ki.
Merhaba Bran, Lois.

121
00:04:54,411 --> 00:04:55,610
- Selam, Ray!- Selam!

122
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,046
Umarım bugün üstüme çok gitmezsiniz.

123
00:04:58,114 --> 00:04:59,480
Merak etme.
Cin ve tonik ister misin?

124
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,083
- Evet.
- Biz açılışı yaptık.

125
00:05:02,152 --> 00:05:03,384
Sizi yetişeceğime eminim.

126
00:05:03,453 --> 00:05:05,420
Pek sanmıyorum.

127
00:05:05,488 --> 00:05:08,590
Tekrar doldurmam gerek.

128
00:05:10,193 --> 00:05:11,609
Lois.

129
00:05:12,963 --> 00:05:14,495
Ee, uçak rötar mı yaptı?

130
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:18,566
Evet. Bu aralar normal galiba.

131
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:22,136
Anne çok güven dolu.

132
00:05:22,205 --> 00:05:23,871
Küçük bir yerde yaşadığımız için

133
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,974
korkacak bir şey olmadığını sanıyor.

134
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:28,309
Bu yüzden kapıyı kilitlemiyor.

135
00:05:28,378 --> 00:05:29,926
Az önce kilitliydi.

136
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,913
Cidden mi?
Sen nasıl girdin o zaman?

137
00:05:31,982 --> 00:05:33,673
Anne bana anahtar verdi.

138
00:05:35,518 --> 00:05:37,018
Dinle.

139
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,020
Ben Annie'nin en yakın arkadaşıyım.

140
00:05:39,045 --> 00:05:42,012
- Evet.
- Mutlu olmasını istiyorum.

141
00:05:42,307 --> 00:05:43,825
Ben de öyle.

142
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:47,428
Güzel çünkü eğer bu işi batırırsan
seni öldürürüm.

143
00:05:52,699 --> 00:06:00,707
Çeviri: oyington.

144
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,811
Pas.

145
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,980
Go Fish oynasak?

146
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:07,548
İhale böyle açılmaz.

147
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,237
Haklısın. Çıkmaza düştüm.

148
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,386
- İhale açamıyor musun?
- Pis yedili olur mu?

149
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,054
Olmaz mı? Peki.

150
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:15,840
Bir... kupa ile açıyorum.

151
00:06:16,426 --> 00:06:17,525
Bir kupa.

152
00:06:17,594 --> 00:06:19,053
- Bu olur.
- İki karo.

153
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:20,194
İki maça.

154
00:06:20,263 --> 00:06:22,730
- Pas.
- Pas, galiba.

155
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,365
- Pas.
- Kupa valesi.

156
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:26,467
Sıra yine bende mi?

157
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:28,169
Hayır, sen battın.

158
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,938
- Biraz sert oldu.
- Elin battı yani.

159
00:06:31,007 --> 00:06:33,207
- Kartları yere açık olarak koy.
- Teşekkürler.

160
00:06:33,276 --> 00:06:35,109
Senin ortağın benim.
Elin batınca

161
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:37,712
bana iyi şanslar dersin.
Gelenek böyle.

162
00:06:37,781 --> 00:06:39,380
Pekala, iyi şanslar, güzellik.

163
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:42,517
Şimdi gidip pastadan bir dilim alabilirsin.

164
00:06:42,585 --> 00:06:44,018
Ben hepsini bitirmeden önce.

165
00:06:44,087 --> 00:06:46,220
Herkes rahatlamış olur.

166
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:47,588
Şunları tokatla.

167
00:06:48,336 --> 00:06:50,925
Anlatsana Lois, küçük bir yerde

168
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,320
polis memuru olmak nasıl bir şey?

169
00:06:52,381 --> 00:06:55,096
Suç belgesellerini sevdiğim için soruyorum.

170
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,497
Öyle mi? Ben de!

171
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:58,966
Podcastleri ve Netflix
belgesellerini seviyorum.

172
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:02,637
Aynen! Onlara bayılıyorum.
The Staircase'i çok sevmiştim.

173
00:07:02,706 --> 00:07:04,238
Yerden bir kupa kızı.

174
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:05,973
Ayrıca okumayı da severim.

175
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:09,030
İlk başta "Soğukkanlılıkla" kitabına
bağımlı olmuştum.

176
00:07:09,114 --> 00:07:10,611
Sonra "Celladın Şarkısı".

177
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,947
Bunu alabilirim. Kupa ası.

178
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,850
- Onu okumadım, Ray.
- Okumalısın, Norman Mailer'ın.

179
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,785
Burada öyle şeyler olmuyor.

180
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,455
Şükürler olsun ki sakin bir kentteyiz.

181
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,590
Silahım var ama hiç kullanmadım.

182
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:24,258
Kullanacağımı da düşünmüyorum.

183
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:27,261
Zeki, tatlı, komik...

184
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,463
Hem de iyi bir aşçı.

185
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,465
Keşke.

186
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,999
Onu Cindi yapıp bize getirdi.

187
00:07:32,068 --> 00:07:34,235
Otopark'taki o küçük kazadan sonra.

188
00:07:34,304 --> 00:07:36,504
Küçük bir kentte böyle özür dilenir.

189
00:07:36,573 --> 00:07:39,240
Tanrı Cindi'yi korusun.
Ve pastalarını.

190
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:41,275
- Sinek altılı.
- Sinek papazı.

191
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:42,543
Sinek yedili.

192
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:43,811
Nasıl tanıştığınızı anlatın hadi.

193
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,480
Yerden sinek dokuzlu.

194
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,482
Briç turnuvasında tanışmadığınız belli.

195
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,284
Parkta tanıştık.

196
00:07:50,353 --> 00:07:52,987
Anne kuşları seyrediyordu.
Ben de Anne'i...

197
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,523
Bir Cape May bülbülünden konuştuk.

198
00:07:55,592 --> 00:07:58,593
Sonra "North by Northwest" izlemeye
gidelim mi dedi.

199
00:07:58,661 --> 00:08:00,068
Ve birinci dakikadan beni ekti.

200
00:08:00,122 --> 00:08:02,897
Ama o zamandan beri telafi ediyor.

201
00:08:02,966 --> 00:08:06,868
Hala devam eden
bir klasik film festivalimiz var.

202
00:08:06,936 --> 00:08:08,903
Müzikal filmlerle başladık.

203
00:08:08,972 --> 00:08:11,439
Filmin sonuna kalmadan uyuyor.

204
00:08:11,508 --> 00:08:12,807
Bu gece değil.

205
00:08:12,876 --> 00:08:17,311
Bu gece 1960lardan
İtalyan sinemasına başlayacağız.

206
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,646
Olamaz.

207
00:08:18,715 --> 00:08:22,984
Kimse uyuyamaz.

208
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:25,486
Batan bile uyuyamaz.

209
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:53,481
Bu döner levhanın çalışabilmesi için
dış konnektöre yeniden

210
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,708
bir kablo lehimlemem gerekecek.

211
00:08:56,186 --> 00:08:58,606
Lehim aletin yok, değil mi?

212
00:08:58,668 --> 00:09:00,354
Hayır.

213
00:09:02,381 --> 00:09:05,326
Bak ne diyeceğim.
Bir koşu hırdavat dükkanına gidip

214
00:09:05,395 --> 00:09:07,562
orada var mı bakayım.

215
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,130
Kamyonu al.

216
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:11,265
Kiralık arabanın benzinini
harcamak istemezsin.

217
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:12,567
Anahtarların yerini biliyorsun.

218
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,269
Bir an önce dans etmeye başlayalım.

219
00:09:18,981 --> 00:09:20,308
Ne oldu?

220
00:09:20,376 --> 00:09:22,376
- Hiçbir şey.
- Hayır, hayır. Ne oldu?

221
00:09:22,445 --> 00:09:25,179
Düpedüz 52 yaşındayım.

222
00:09:25,248 --> 00:09:27,048
Bir adamla evliydim.

223
00:09:27,116 --> 00:09:30,184
Lise aşkımla, 25 yıl boyunca...

224
00:09:30,253 --> 00:09:34,372
Bir kitap kulübündeyim,
pazar günleri kiliseye giderim.

225
00:09:34,924 --> 00:09:37,391
Ve nasıl olduysa
biriyle ilişki içerisindeyim.

226
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,294
"Dış konnektör" gibi kelimeler kullanan biriyle...

227
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,332
O bunu yaparken benim
tek düşündüğüm seks.

228
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,766
Zaten "dış konnektör" derken

229
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,343
benim de aklımda o var.

230
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:01,805
Tekrar yok.

231
00:10:01,918 --> 00:10:03,885
Düşmanlarının bir adım önünde

232
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:06,220
olmak için ilk kural bu demiştin.

233
00:10:25,464 --> 00:10:27,030
Pazartesi gitmek zorunda mısın?

234
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:30,613
Yani, zorundasın biliyorum. Ama...

235
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,479
Keşke gitmesen.

236
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,184
Kalmak için her şeyi yapardım.

237
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,140
Ama işlerin var.

238
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,456
Bu sefer özellikle...

239
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:44,458
stresli bir zaman.

240
00:10:44,527 --> 00:10:46,193
"Stresli".

241
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:50,231
Yapmak ve korumak için

242
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:57,271
yıllarca uğraştığım bir şey

243
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,073
tehlike altında.

244
00:10:59,142 --> 00:11:03,177
Senin için çok zor olmalı. Üzgünüm.

245
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,646
Senin için yapabileceğim bir şey var mı?

246
00:11:05,963 --> 00:11:07,615
Zaten yapıyorsun.

247
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,940
- Ben ciddiyim.
- Ben de.

248
00:11:10,053 --> 00:11:14,355
Dışarıda hayatım karmakarışık.

249
00:11:14,805 --> 00:11:17,099
Buradaysa değil.

250
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:19,493
Sıkıntılarını azaltmaktan

251
00:11:19,562 --> 00:11:22,496
fazlasını yapmak istiyorum.

252
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,024
Onları seninle birlikte taşımak istiyorum.

253
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:28,444
Sorunların ne olduğunu söylemezsen
bunu yapamam.

254
00:11:30,006 --> 00:11:31,405
Anne.

255
00:11:31,474 --> 00:11:33,074
Efendim?

256
00:11:35,244 --> 00:11:36,994
Dans etmek ister misin?

257
00:12:59,177 --> 00:13:01,211
Parmak izlerini araştırmış değilim.

258
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,146
Ama bunu yapmaktan çekinmezdim.

259
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:06,016
Suç belgeseli seviyor diye mi?
Ben de seviyorum.

260
00:13:06,084 --> 00:13:09,152
Diyorum ki onun hakkında
neredeyse hiçbir şey bilmiyorsun.

261
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,755
Çok şey biliyorum.

262
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,558
Beni nasıl hissettirdiğini biliyorum.

263
00:13:15,627 --> 00:13:18,361
Bir işi olduğunu ve
sorunları olduğunu biliyorum.

264
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,031
Ve o buradayken bütün
o sorunlar uçup gidiyor.

265
00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:23,133
Ne işi? Ne sorunları?

266
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:26,102
Biliyorum, aşırı koruyucu bir arkadaşım.

267
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:28,071
Başkalarının işine karışmamalıyım.

268
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,308
Sadece, New York'tan kimseyle tanışmamıştım.

269
00:13:31,376 --> 00:13:35,045
Hele ki saldırgan,
kaba ve tamamen narsist olan biriyle.

270
00:13:35,113 --> 00:13:37,380
Bir kere o New Yorklu değil.

271
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:40,583
Ve Lois, bütün dünyaya görünmezim.

272
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:41,951
Ama ona değil.

273
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,554
O beni görüyor ve
onu bu yüzden seviyorum.

274
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,846
Gerçekten, seviyorum.

275
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,849
Sevdiğini biliyor muydu?

276
00:13:52,887 --> 00:13:54,121
Hayır.

277
00:13:54,241 --> 00:13:56,051
Artık biliyor.

278
00:13:56,968 --> 00:13:58,868
Günaydın, hanımlar.

279
00:13:58,937 --> 00:14:02,038
O kahve nefis kokuyor.

280
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:03,907
Günaydın.

281
00:14:05,577 --> 00:14:08,064
Aç mısın? Çorek aldım.

282
00:14:08,117 --> 00:14:09,379
Sağ ol, Lois!

283
00:14:09,898 --> 00:14:13,616
Ama gevreği tercih ederim.
Narsistler böyle kahvaltı yapar.

284
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:18,088
So we can gaze admiringly at
our reflection in the spoon.

285
00:14:18,113 --> 00:14:20,914
I better get on into the station.

286
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:24,527
Sorry.

287
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:29,167
Goodbye, Lois.

288
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:40,136
Have I told you about
the fork-tailed flycatcher?

289
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,296
She's right.

290
00:14:42,469 --> 00:14:44,781
How they gather near
the elm trees south of town?

291
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,150
You know almost nothing about me.

292
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,119
I know everything I need to know...

293
00:14:49,187 --> 00:14:52,155
Unless, of course,
those "business problems"

294
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,980
are a euphemism for a wife
or a husband somewhere.

295
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:56,860
No wife. No husband.

296
00:14:56,928 --> 00:14:59,229
But there is a cat.

297
00:14:59,297 --> 00:15:03,159
As well as other things
you should know about me.

298
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:04,934
About who I am.

299
00:15:05,003 --> 00:15:07,997
Raymond. I know who you are.

300
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,908
You're someone who needs to see
the fork-tailed flycatcher.

301
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,843
Which I intend to show you,

302
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:17,259
just as soon as I find my binoculars.

303
00:15:17,336 --> 00:15:18,615
I'm gonna go upstairs,

304
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,551
and you're gonna make us
some sandwiches to take with.

305
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,852
How's that sound?

306
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:24,821
It sounds just right.

307
00:15:32,764 --> 00:15:35,165
I found two pairs and a blanket.

308
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:37,400
I found salami and cheese.

309
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:40,570
I'll get a basket for the food,
and we're good to go.

310
00:15:40,634 --> 00:15:42,405
You told me the flycatcher

311
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:46,910
can range as far south as lower Mexico,

312
00:15:46,978 --> 00:15:51,548
and some have even been spotted
as far down as Argentina.

313
00:15:51,616 --> 00:15:52,982
What was that?

314
00:15:53,626 --> 00:15:55,151
Nothing. I was just...

315
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,592
What were you saying?

316
00:16:02,969 --> 00:16:05,295
I was saying... I was remembering

317
00:16:05,363 --> 00:16:09,966
that you said you were thinking
about becoming a vegetarian.

318
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,502
That pipe dream was about 12 pounds ago.

319
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,338
That's something my doctor
is always bugging me about.

320
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,407
Didn't you say there was an excellent

321
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,542
vegan sandwich shop in town?

322
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:22,312
- But you're already making lunch.
- Which we can bring,

323
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,482
in case the tofurkey is inedible.

324
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:29,219
Why don't you run into town,
order for both of us?

325
00:16:29,287 --> 00:16:33,056
I'll finish up, pack, and be
ready to go when you get back.

326
00:16:33,124 --> 00:16:35,310
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

327
00:16:36,027 --> 00:16:39,762
Okay. Two tofurkey sandwiches comin' up.

328
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,801
Oh. Hey, there.

329
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:21,170
Hey. Here on a call. Won't be long.

330
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:24,173
A call? Really?
What seems to be the problem?

331
00:17:24,242 --> 00:17:26,242
County sent me.
Area's been having outages.

332
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,611
I just gotta check your
ground wires. It's standard.

333
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,380
Okay. Very good.

334
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:32,248
Vague, but detailed enough.

335
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,150
Delivered with authority.

336
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:35,818
I'm not sure what you mean.

337
00:17:36,479 --> 00:17:38,189
You know what I mean.

338
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:41,658
Listen, mister, if it helps, I
got the work order right here.

339
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:44,694
Great.

340
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,429
Ugh!

341
00:17:47,532 --> 00:17:49,999
How many are coming?

342
00:17:52,078 --> 00:17:53,403
Everyone.

343
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:58,807
You found Arkham.

344
00:18:58,808 --> 00:19:00,560
In a chest freezer in the garage.

345
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,076
His weapon's gone, vehicle's gone.

346
00:19:02,145 --> 00:19:04,429
The girlfriend, Miss Foster.
Ping her cell.

347
00:19:04,454 --> 00:19:06,150
She left less than 20 minutes ago.

348
00:19:06,175 --> 00:19:07,922
Reddington wasn't far behind.

349
00:19:07,991 --> 00:19:10,124
Wherever she's going,
that's where he's going.

350
00:19:10,193 --> 00:19:14,199
Copy that. What do you want to
do about the missing vehicle?

351
00:19:21,905 --> 00:19:23,304
Reddington.

352
00:19:23,373 --> 00:19:25,240
This is between you and me.

353
00:19:25,308 --> 00:19:27,075
It has nothing to do with her.

354
00:19:27,143 --> 00:19:28,943
You must be referring to Miss Foster.

355
00:19:29,012 --> 00:19:31,312
She has no idea who I am.

356
00:19:31,381 --> 00:19:32,947
My family had no idea who you were.

357
00:19:33,016 --> 00:19:35,563
They didn't know why they were
singled out or targeted,

358
00:19:35,588 --> 00:19:37,721
but that didn't prevent their suffering.

359
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:40,925
You still have time to rethink
this. It's not too late.

360
00:19:40,993 --> 00:19:42,927
It's interesting to me
how you speak as if you have

361
00:19:42,995 --> 00:19:45,396
any say in how this
will end for you, Raymond...

362
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:47,587
as if it can somehow
be resolved in a civil manner.

363
00:19:47,612 --> 00:19:49,846
The one thing I can assure you of...

364
00:19:50,002 --> 00:19:53,337
The one thing... is that
what is about to happen

365
00:19:53,406 --> 00:19:55,639
is going to be anything but civil.

366
00:19:57,577 --> 00:19:59,677
They got a track
on the woman's cell.

367
00:19:59,745 --> 00:20:01,178
She's close.

368
00:20:01,203 --> 00:20:03,123
I have a second team
on their way to her now.

369
00:20:15,394 --> 00:20:16,927
- Anne.
- Hey. What are you doing here?

370
00:20:16,996 --> 00:20:19,130
If you needed something else,
you could've called me.

371
00:20:19,198 --> 00:20:20,631
I need you to come with me.

372
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,268
Is that blood on your hand?
What happened?

373
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,722
I'll explain in the car.

374
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,574
Raymond, are you okay? I-I don't...

375
00:20:30,643 --> 00:20:32,977
What's... What's going on?

376
00:20:35,815 --> 00:20:37,741
Stay with me.

377
00:20:41,954 --> 00:20:43,888
Raymond, please, where are we going?

378
00:20:43,956 --> 00:20:45,990
- Give me your phone.
- Raymond, what on earth is wrong?

379
00:20:46,058 --> 00:20:49,527
- Your phone, please.
- Raymond, you're scaring me.

380
00:20:49,595 --> 00:20:52,696
What's going on? And who's that woman?

381
00:21:00,341 --> 00:21:01,514
Here.

382
00:21:04,006 --> 00:21:05,943
Hello. Can I help you?

383
00:21:08,614 --> 00:21:10,478
- You should leave.
- Is that a gun?!

384
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:12,149
Raymond!

385
00:21:12,285 --> 00:21:13,751
Here. Come with me.

386
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:16,420
No! Answer my question!
What is going on?

387
00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:17,922
I'm not who you think I am.

388
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:20,558
I have another life, and
that life found us here today.

389
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:22,893
We are in danger, and
I need to keep you safe...

390
00:21:22,962 --> 00:21:24,562
Someone wants to hurt you?

391
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,331
They want to hurt us.

392
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:30,187
Here. Stay here. Stay quiet.

393
00:21:30,268 --> 00:21:32,336
Only open the door if it's me.

394
00:21:32,361 --> 00:21:34,528
Anyone else, shoot. Do you understand?

395
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,042
Just point and pull the trigger.

396
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,613
- Anne.
- Raymond.

397
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:31,579
- W-What did you do?
- We have to go.

398
00:22:32,698 --> 00:22:34,732
Who was that woman?

399
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,835
- Please, just try and keep up.
- Where are you taking me?

400
00:22:37,903 --> 00:22:40,971
I don't want... stop! Let go of my hand!

401
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,974
Anne, please. Listen to me.
There are people coming for us.

402
00:22:44,043 --> 00:22:47,044
It's not safe. You need to come with me.

403
00:22:47,069 --> 00:22:48,835
Come with you where?

404
00:22:57,423 --> 00:22:59,362
Officers, may I have
your attention, please?

405
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,492
- I'm sorry to interrupt.
- What are you two doing here?

406
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,914
May I please have your attention?

407
00:23:02,939 --> 00:23:05,266
- My name is Raymond Reddington.
- Listen to what he has to say.

408
00:23:05,398 --> 00:23:08,666
I'm a wanted fugitive. I have
two firearms on my person.

409
00:23:08,734 --> 00:23:11,068
- Gun!
- Someone will need to disarm me.

410
00:23:12,172 --> 00:23:13,871
Lois, we have a situation.

411
00:23:14,073 --> 00:23:16,649
I need you to listen to me
very carefully.

412
00:23:25,526 --> 00:23:27,625
Chief! Agent Barnes again on three.

413
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:29,425
- Says they have confirmation.
- Agents en route?

414
00:23:29,494 --> 00:23:31,176
In the air now. 40 minutes out.

415
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,768
Within 40 minutes, everyone in
this building could be dead.

416
00:23:33,837 --> 00:23:35,136
You really are him.

417
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:38,273
Lois, you need
to get her somewhere safe.

418
00:23:38,341 --> 00:23:40,235
Now. We don't have much time.

419
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:42,290
You need to contact the highway patrol

420
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,913
and sheriff's department
and any available units

421
00:23:44,981 --> 00:23:46,981
- from other counties.
- Can someone shut him up?

422
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,886
Chief, I got someone from the
D.C. field office on line two.

423
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,153
They are coming here.

424
00:23:51,178 --> 00:23:53,011
Dangerous, highly trained mercenaries.

425
00:23:53,168 --> 00:23:56,369
He's not making it up.
I saw him kill a woman.

426
00:23:56,438 --> 00:23:57,770
Kill who?

427
00:23:57,795 --> 00:23:59,562
Lois, look at me.

428
00:23:59,587 --> 00:24:02,722
I am the most wanted man to
ever come through those doors...

429
00:24:02,877 --> 00:24:05,845
By a lot... And I came here by choice,

430
00:24:05,914 --> 00:24:08,481
not to surrender myself,
but to protect Anne

431
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:11,517
from the very bad men who are coming.

432
00:24:11,586 --> 00:24:13,519
You need to get her somewhere safe,

433
00:24:13,588 --> 00:24:15,722
because they will not be
intimidated by the fact

434
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,391
that you're the police.
They will assault this building

435
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,660
and kill everyone inside to get to me.

436
00:24:20,729 --> 00:24:23,930
Please, get on the mutual-aid
band and scramble any units

437
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:27,600
within earshot, because this
is happening right now.

438
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:30,436
It isn't just Wichita
coming for you, friend.

439
00:24:30,505 --> 00:24:34,307
Kansas City suits are on
the way, a team out of D.C.

440
00:24:34,376 --> 00:24:36,843
Chief, will you
take a look at this?

441
00:24:37,302 --> 00:24:39,846
Anne, talk to me. What do you
mean he killed someone?

442
00:24:39,914 --> 00:24:41,948
- Killed who?
- I don't know who she was.

443
00:24:42,017 --> 00:24:43,283
You saw him do it?

444
00:24:43,767 --> 00:24:45,151
Neither one has plates.

445
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,186
You may want to get away
from those doors, Chief.

446
00:24:47,255 --> 00:24:50,089
- What is happening?
- They're here, aren't they?

447
00:24:50,158 --> 00:24:51,758
Lois, I am begging you.

448
00:24:51,826 --> 00:24:54,494
You've got to get your boss
to enact lockdown protocols.

449
00:24:54,562 --> 00:24:56,929
Get on the radio,
whatever cavalry you have,

450
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:58,840
call them in, now!

451
00:24:58,909 --> 00:25:01,167
She doesn't have
the authority to give that order,

452
00:25:01,236 --> 00:25:03,469
and you sure as hell
aren't authorized to give it.

453
00:25:03,538 --> 00:25:05,138
You need to get ahead of this, Chief.

454
00:25:05,206 --> 00:25:09,142
Sir, he's right. Whatever
this is, we are not equipped.

455
00:25:15,617 --> 00:25:17,150
Okay. Here's what we're gonna do.

456
00:25:17,218 --> 00:25:20,386
I want all nonessential
personnel out of the building.

457
00:25:20,411 --> 00:25:22,144
Beth, get the others
and go out the back.

458
00:25:22,257 --> 00:25:25,758
Pembry, find out what units
County has in the area

459
00:25:25,783 --> 00:25:27,750
- and where they are!
- Brandt, notify Butler

460
00:25:27,775 --> 00:25:31,773
and Lyon counties
and put local EMS on standby.

461
00:25:32,367 --> 00:25:34,234
Who are you?

462
00:25:36,905 --> 00:25:39,906
You need somewhere safe
where you can hide.

463
00:25:42,939 --> 00:25:44,310
That was Reeves.

464
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:46,302
There was an incident in town,

465
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:48,194
but they have eyes on Reddington.

466
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,549
What kind of incident?

467
00:25:49,617 --> 00:25:51,851
Landon. She's gone.

468
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,753
- And Reddington?
- He took the woman

469
00:25:53,822 --> 00:25:55,722
and went into the local police station.

470
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,790
Ah. Raymond.

471
00:25:57,859 --> 00:25:59,472
You do keep things interesting.

472
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:00,927
How you wanna handle this?

473
00:26:00,995 --> 00:26:04,030
Put Sagan on the police scanners
and have him give us a timeframe.

474
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:07,467
If we're going to do this, it's
gonna have to happen fast...

475
00:26:07,535 --> 00:26:09,402
and happen now.

476
00:26:09,811 --> 00:26:11,437
I just spoke to County.

477
00:26:11,506 --> 00:26:12,872
They're sending units now.

478
00:26:12,941 --> 00:26:14,841
Gonna take Anne to Emporia
and hold her there

479
00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:16,542
until we have a better handle on this.

480
00:26:17,027 --> 00:26:18,378
You can't wait for units.

481
00:26:18,446 --> 00:26:19,812
You need to get her out of here now.

482
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,414
Feds are 20 minutes out.

483
00:26:21,439 --> 00:26:22,905
How could you not tell me?

484
00:26:23,017 --> 00:26:25,818
I let you into my life, my home.

485
00:26:25,887 --> 00:26:28,788
I never wanted to draw you
into my life, Anne.

486
00:26:28,857 --> 00:26:31,090
I only wanted to escape into yours.

487
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:32,792
How selfish...

488
00:26:32,861 --> 00:26:35,328
You getting involved with me
while knowing all of this

489
00:26:35,397 --> 00:26:36,662
was hanging over us.

490
00:26:36,731 --> 00:26:39,716
I let my feelings for you
cloud my judgment.

491
00:26:40,068 --> 00:26:41,634
I am so sorry.

492
00:26:44,506 --> 00:26:46,181
When this is over...

493
00:26:46,641 --> 00:26:48,308
so are we.

494
00:26:51,546 --> 00:26:53,413
Chief, take a look at this.

495
00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:56,582
That second SUV moved.
It repositioned around back.

496
00:26:56,651 --> 00:26:58,251
We have a third out front now.

497
00:27:16,604 --> 00:27:19,138
Cottonwood Falls Police. Chief Russell.

498
00:27:19,207 --> 00:27:20,840
Chief! How wonderful.

499
00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:22,642
I presume you're the man in charge.

500
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,110
I am. Who is this?

501
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:26,446
I am the one who is here
for Mr. Reddington.

502
00:27:26,514 --> 00:27:29,348
I'm confident he's explained
the situation to you by now.

503
00:27:29,417 --> 00:27:31,784
You also know the closest units
are nine minutes out,

504
00:27:31,853 --> 00:27:34,754
which gives me eight minutes
to acquire my prisoner.

505
00:27:34,823 --> 00:27:36,722
Send him out now, you live.

506
00:27:36,791 --> 00:27:38,658
Surrender and walk away, you live.

507
00:27:38,726 --> 00:27:40,092
Stay and protect him,

508
00:27:40,161 --> 00:27:42,929
and we kill everyone
who stands in our path.

509
00:27:42,997 --> 00:27:45,131
You have 60 seconds to send him out.

510
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,468
Okay. Hold on. Let... Let's
start with who am I speaking to?

511
00:27:48,536 --> 00:27:49,902
Fifty-five.

512
00:27:55,066 --> 00:27:56,266
- Chief?
- Fifty.

513
00:27:56,377 --> 00:27:57,610
These guys are heavily armed.

514
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,011
They're surrounding the facility.

515
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,554
Hold on. L-Look. Anne, get down.

516
00:28:00,635 --> 00:28:03,983
Why don't I come outside and we
can talk, have a conversation?

517
00:28:04,052 --> 00:28:05,802
Forty-five.

518
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,023
You still there? Can you hear me?

519
00:28:11,092 --> 00:28:12,892
Look. I don't care who you are.

520
00:28:12,961 --> 00:28:14,627
I'm not gonna bend to your demands,

521
00:28:14,696 --> 00:28:16,963
and I'm certainly not gonna
send a man to his death,

522
00:28:17,031 --> 00:28:18,931
even if he is a known criminal.

523
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,501
What I will do is talk to you
until we come up with

524
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:23,169
some reasonable compro...

525
00:28:23,238 --> 00:28:25,071
Chief!

526
00:28:30,107 --> 00:28:31,577
That was unfortunate.

527
00:28:31,646 --> 00:28:33,513
But let's hope whoever
is second-in-command

528
00:28:33,581 --> 00:28:35,414
can be more reasonable.

529
00:28:35,483 --> 00:28:37,216
Send out Reddington.

530
00:28:38,001 --> 00:28:39,794
Now you're in charge.

531
00:28:48,043 --> 00:28:50,044
Shots fired. Repeat. Shots fired.

532
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:52,146
We have active shooters
on site. Officer down.

533
00:28:52,214 --> 00:28:53,814
Requesting backup.

534
00:28:56,593 --> 00:28:58,793
We got state troopers
east of Elmdale headed our way.

535
00:28:58,847 --> 00:29:00,513
County units are still
eight minutes out.

536
00:29:00,582 --> 00:29:02,240
If you have a weapons cache, open it.

537
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:05,117
We need to take positions
and push them back now.

538
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,512
- I'm not giving you a weapon.
- Staying alive until

539
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:10,004
backup arrives is
the only thing you can do.

540
00:29:10,029 --> 00:29:12,276
No. You know what I can do?

541
00:29:12,676 --> 00:29:14,309
End this by giving them what they want.

542
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:15,743
- What does that mean?
- Look. Stop!

543
00:29:15,812 --> 00:29:17,812
We're not sending him
out there to be massacred.

544
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,447
- I am not protecting him!
- Hold on!

545
00:29:19,516 --> 00:29:21,249
- Keep your heads down.
- She's right, Brandt.

546
00:29:21,318 --> 00:29:22,802
We can't send him out there.
They'll kill him.

547
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:25,136
- Just let me think this through.
- What is there to think about?!

548
00:29:25,205 --> 00:29:27,505
I am not dying for him.
The Chief already did that.

549
00:29:27,574 --> 00:29:29,808
- Brandt, stop!
- Do not go out that door.

550
00:29:29,876 --> 00:29:31,276
I'm coming out!

551
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:34,100
I'm unarmed!

552
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,748
You can see that, right?

553
00:29:37,353 --> 00:29:38,896
No games.

554
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:41,190
I just want to walk away.

555
00:29:41,985 --> 00:29:44,389
Oh!

556
00:29:49,813 --> 00:29:51,512
That man has two children!

557
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:54,375
I thought police understood
rules. I told you the rules.

558
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:55,710
You don't get to change your mind.

559
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:58,005
I gave you 60 seconds
to send Reddington out.

560
00:29:58,141 --> 00:30:00,241
You ignored me, so now I'm coming in.

561
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:03,711
The only thing that can stop
that is sending Reddington out.

562
00:30:08,996 --> 00:30:10,663
No?

563
00:30:10,954 --> 00:30:13,017
Okay. Be right there.

564
00:30:13,582 --> 00:30:14,814
You need to uncuff me.

565
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:17,439
Lois, I can give them what they want.

566
00:30:17,464 --> 00:30:18,897
You need to uncuff me.

567
00:30:19,178 --> 00:30:21,767
I'll uncuff you, but
you're not going out there.

568
00:30:21,851 --> 00:30:23,286
No. What are you doing? You can't!

569
00:30:23,311 --> 00:30:25,184
Annie, he's Raymond Reddington.

570
00:30:25,301 --> 00:30:28,736
If we're gonna survive this,
he's the only chance we've got.

571
00:30:28,761 --> 00:30:30,928
I'm removing these cuffs,
but so help me God,

572
00:30:30,953 --> 00:30:33,721
if we get out of here alive,
I am arresting you.

573
00:30:33,746 --> 00:30:36,013
If you try to escape, I'll
shoot you. Do you understand?

574
00:30:36,105 --> 00:30:38,539
Given the circumstances,
that's not much of a threat.

575
00:30:38,564 --> 00:30:40,730
But, yes, I understand.

576
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,923
Maybe we should give Anne a sidearm.

577
00:30:43,992 --> 00:30:46,426
- I don't want one.
- It could save your life.

578
00:30:46,495 --> 00:30:47,961
Give it to her.

579
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:50,430
This is for our defense only.

580
00:30:50,499 --> 00:30:52,966
If this building is breached,
and only if it's breached,

581
00:30:53,034 --> 00:30:55,001
you have my authorization to...

582
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:04,277
Chase County Sheriff,
this is Officer Ethan Pembry.

583
00:31:04,346 --> 00:31:06,646
How far are those units?

584
00:31:08,517 --> 00:31:11,985
The detention cell!
Is it fully enclosed?

585
00:31:12,053 --> 00:31:14,354
It is, but we can't access it!

586
00:31:14,422 --> 00:31:16,656
- What? Why not?
- I don't have the keys.

587
00:31:16,725 --> 00:31:18,513
- Brandt does.
- Brandt?

588
00:31:22,063 --> 00:31:23,329
- I can get them.
- No, no, no!

589
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:24,831
- We have to!
- It's too dangerous!

590
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,633
No, Lois! No!

591
00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:38,878
No, no, no!

592
00:31:40,782 --> 00:31:42,482
Aah!

593
00:31:47,189 --> 00:31:49,455
Get her to the holding cell.

594
00:32:11,899 --> 00:32:13,832
There we go.

595
00:32:24,426 --> 00:32:26,392
Keys. Where are the keys?

596
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,396
Here. Here.

597
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:35,902
Okay.

598
00:32:56,591 --> 00:32:59,826
Well. Look what we have here.

599
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,060
Three ducks in a barrel.

600
00:33:01,129 --> 00:33:03,696
Anne. Keep your eyes on Lois.

601
00:33:04,939 --> 00:33:06,232
Get the door off.

602
00:33:10,605 --> 00:33:12,171
Just ignore him.

603
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,442
Heh! This certainly is interesting.

604
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:20,980
Give me your scarf.

605
00:33:28,356 --> 00:33:29,822
Mr. Reddington!

606
00:33:29,891 --> 00:33:31,491
Take her hand.

607
00:33:33,439 --> 00:33:35,107
Hello?

608
00:33:43,491 --> 00:33:45,491
You should have left her
out of this, Neville.

609
00:33:46,351 --> 00:33:47,740
It's over.

610
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:49,342
This was between us.

611
00:33:49,411 --> 00:33:51,511
You're coming with me, Raymond.

612
00:33:51,579 --> 00:33:53,980
We're ending this today. Here.

613
00:33:54,049 --> 00:33:57,583
Yes, I'd like to agree with you,
but then we'd both be wrong.

614
00:33:57,652 --> 00:34:00,053
So, in turn, how about this...

615
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:03,656
Take your men and your guns...

616
00:34:03,681 --> 00:34:06,315
and your bloodshed... and go.

617
00:34:06,847 --> 00:34:08,895
Then come find me when you're ready,

618
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:11,364
and I'll show you the proper way
to exact revenge.

619
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,602
Sir? We need to go. Right now.

620
00:34:23,044 --> 00:34:25,324
The medics will be here any minute.

621
00:34:26,114 --> 00:34:28,714
- Keep pressure on the wound.
- Mm-hmm.

622
00:34:28,783 --> 00:34:32,185
I'm sorry, Anne. I wish I
belonged here with you, but I don't.

623
00:34:35,457 --> 00:34:37,056
No. Stop.

624
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:39,959
I told you if we survived this,
I'd arrest you.

625
00:34:40,241 --> 00:34:42,041
You're under arrest.

626
00:35:08,715 --> 00:35:11,082
It's all right. You okay?

627
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:13,218
Yeah.

628
00:35:13,286 --> 00:35:14,319
FBI.

629
00:35:16,423 --> 00:35:18,723
She needs a doctor.

630
00:35:18,792 --> 00:35:21,092
Station's clear. We need paramedics.

631
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:23,728
- Did you find Reddington?
- He was here?

632
00:35:23,797 --> 00:35:25,597
Clear!

633
00:35:26,366 --> 00:35:28,763
- I tried to stop him.
- You didn't find him?

634
00:35:28,788 --> 00:35:31,288
Not yet, but knowing he was
here, we'll drop a net so wide,

635
00:35:31,357 --> 00:35:33,557
even he won't be able to escape.

636
00:35:36,076 --> 00:35:38,440
- Who did this?
- My friend.

637
00:35:39,566 --> 00:35:41,165
I'm not sure where
you learned this, friend,

638
00:35:41,234 --> 00:35:43,293
but you saved her life.

639
00:35:44,112 --> 00:35:46,036
Reddington was in town visiting you?

640
00:35:46,105 --> 00:35:47,805
I didn't know who he was.

641
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,940
I'm told he came quite often.

642
00:35:50,009 --> 00:35:51,375
That's right. He did.

643
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,711
But you didn't know who he was?

644
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,881
You mean, was my life so boring
that I was willing

645
00:35:56,949 --> 00:35:59,884
to spice it up by dating
an international fugitive?

646
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:01,542
No. It was not.

647
00:36:01,654 --> 00:36:03,988
But it turns out it was boring
enough for me to get suckered

648
00:36:04,056 --> 00:36:07,391
by an international fugitive
into thinking he cared about me.

649
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,760
Now that I know the truth, believe me,

650
00:36:09,829 --> 00:36:11,595
if I can help you find him,

651
00:36:12,015 --> 00:36:13,531
well, that would be my pleasure.

652
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,799
Glad to hear it, because
I have a lot of questions.

653
00:36:15,868 --> 00:36:18,335
And I'll answer every one,
but I need to go home first.

654
00:36:18,404 --> 00:36:20,137
One of my men will accompany you.

655
00:36:20,162 --> 00:36:21,962
She's a victim, not a suspect.

656
00:36:22,317 --> 00:36:23,928
She's also my oldest friend.

657
00:36:23,971 --> 00:36:25,476
I don't want you hounding her.

658
00:36:25,545 --> 00:36:28,879
I just need to shower, change,
and have a good cry.

659
00:36:29,424 --> 00:36:32,216
And then I'll answer
anything you want to ask.

660
00:36:32,994 --> 00:36:35,519
My car's in the lot.
Mind taking it home?

661
00:36:35,588 --> 00:36:37,488
Of course not. I'll be at the hospital

662
00:36:37,557 --> 00:36:39,957
just as soon as I've answered
their questions.

663
00:36:40,026 --> 00:36:41,625
I wish we'd caught him.

664
00:36:41,694 --> 00:36:44,395
But knowing he's out of your life,

665
00:36:44,463 --> 00:36:46,864
I do get some satisfaction in that.

666
00:36:50,937 --> 00:36:53,771
I told you if we survived
this, I'd arrest you.

667
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,406
You're under arrest.

668
00:36:55,474 --> 00:36:58,375
Anne watched you kill someone.
I saw you kill three more.

669
00:36:58,444 --> 00:37:00,578
We're alive because of that.

670
00:37:00,646 --> 00:37:03,787
Not my chief. Not Pembry or Brandt.

671
00:37:03,832 --> 00:37:05,316
They're dead because of you.

672
00:37:05,384 --> 00:37:08,118
I kept telling them
what they needed to do,

673
00:37:08,187 --> 00:37:09,787
and they didn't do it.

674
00:37:09,855 --> 00:37:12,523
You were right. About him.

675
00:37:12,592 --> 00:37:15,292
The wolf in sheep's clothing.
But you were wrong, too.

676
00:37:15,361 --> 00:37:18,529
- Anne, don't.
- You don't understand.

677
00:37:18,598 --> 00:37:20,831
- You need to move!
- I can't.

678
00:37:21,251 --> 00:37:22,866
I won't.

679
00:37:46,726 --> 00:37:50,327
Lois said to take the Falls Road
east out of town.

680
00:37:50,396 --> 00:37:52,429
Most of the staties
don't even know it exists.

681
00:37:52,498 --> 00:37:54,965
Nobody will be watching.
She's a good friend.

682
00:37:55,368 --> 00:37:56,745
The best.

683
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,591
The man who came after you today...

684
00:37:59,636 --> 00:38:01,272
Neville Townsend.

685
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,540
He won't stop, will he?

686
00:38:05,244 --> 00:38:07,923
You were right. At the station.

687
00:38:08,381 --> 00:38:10,314
Us, getting involved.

688
00:38:10,383 --> 00:38:12,216
It was selfish of me.

689
00:38:12,285 --> 00:38:14,084
It put you in harm's way.

690
00:38:14,153 --> 00:38:15,519
It still puts you there.

691
00:38:15,588 --> 00:38:17,221
If I'm in trouble either way,

692
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:18,689
why can't we be together?

693
00:38:18,758 --> 00:38:21,392
Because what I have to do
and how I have to do it,

694
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,260
you can't be a part of that.

695
00:38:23,285 --> 00:38:25,252
No one should be a part of that.

696
00:38:32,905 --> 00:38:36,340
It won't be safe here until it's done.

697
00:38:36,409 --> 00:38:38,175
I understand.

698
00:38:38,244 --> 00:38:39,710
Is there somewhere you can go?

699
00:38:39,779 --> 00:38:42,446
And not to your daughter's.
They'll anticipate that.

700
00:38:42,515 --> 00:38:45,382
My friend Cindi,
the one who made the cake.

701
00:38:45,451 --> 00:38:46,884
She has a cabin.

702
00:38:46,952 --> 00:38:49,286
Call her. See if you can go there.

703
00:38:49,355 --> 00:38:52,623
When it's safe,
you'll receive a postcard.

704
00:38:52,692 --> 00:38:55,106
It'll be from the Corn Palace
in Mitchell, South Dakota.

705
00:38:55,188 --> 00:38:56,766
That's how you'll know it's me.

706
00:38:56,856 --> 00:38:59,463
But you don't know the address.

707
00:38:59,532 --> 00:39:02,533
I have certain... capabilities.

708
00:39:03,061 --> 00:39:05,269
Too bad staying awake for
a movie isn't one of them.

709
00:39:07,707 --> 00:39:09,192
Ahh...

710
00:39:10,042 --> 00:39:11,278
Thank you.

711
00:39:11,797 --> 00:39:13,071
For what?

712
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,825
For... all of it.

713
00:39:17,616 --> 00:39:20,084
Every... Every bit of it.

714
00:39:20,662 --> 00:39:22,486
Except the bridge.

715
00:39:22,999 --> 00:39:24,655
Of all the things that
happened on this trip,

716
00:39:24,724 --> 00:39:26,585
the bridge scared me the most.

717
00:39:29,061 --> 00:39:30,964
Take care, Dummy.

718
00:39:32,882 --> 00:39:34,732
You take care, Anne.

719
00:39:58,023 --> 00:39:59,490
Yes. Y-Yes.

720
00:39:59,558 --> 00:40:01,725
Sam's Diner. Route 28.

721
00:40:01,794 --> 00:40:05,496
I should be able to ditch
the car and be there in an hour.

722
00:40:05,915 --> 00:40:07,375
And, Dembe...

723
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,629
you definitely should have come with me.

724
00:40:11,604 --> 00:40:14,705
Yeah. O-Okay.

725
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:20,644
...by another ten days,
uh...

726
00:40:20,713 --> 00:40:22,446
...is starting to...

727
00:40:22,515 --> 00:40:25,215
♪ For it was I who chose to start ♪

728
00:40:30,923 --> 00:40:35,426
♪ I see no reason to take me home ♪

729
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:40,871
♪ I'm old enough to face the dawn ♪

730
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:05,522
Ah, damn it.

731
00:41:32,985 --> 00:41:34,852
Anne. Annie.

732
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,019
Elizabeth.
