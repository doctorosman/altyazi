1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,821
Previously on "The Blacklist"...

2
00:00:01,846 --> 00:00:03,389
Do you mind if I join you?

3
00:00:03,458 --> 00:00:05,858
- I'm Anne.
- Raymond.

4
00:00:05,927 --> 00:00:09,729
I don't know, Anne. I think your
life sounds rather balanced.

5
00:00:09,754 --> 00:00:11,261
I like to think it is.

6
00:00:11,286 --> 00:00:12,986
- What do you do?
- I'm a fugitive.

7
00:00:13,268 --> 00:00:15,177
Some people like to live dangerously.

8
00:00:15,201 --> 00:00:16,500
What do you have in mind?

9
00:00:16,569 --> 00:00:17,835
You. Helping me.

10
00:00:17,903 --> 00:00:19,703
Finding a souvenir for my sister.

11
00:00:19,772 --> 00:00:23,674
I know an extraordinary tiny, tiny,

12
00:00:23,743 --> 00:00:26,076
"barely enough room for the both of us"

13
00:00:26,145 --> 00:00:27,544
chocolate shop.

14
00:00:27,613 --> 00:00:29,780
What about "North by Northwest"?

15
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:32,282
It's playing at
the Village East tomorrow,

16
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:33,784
midnight screening.

17
00:00:33,853 --> 00:00:37,421
You'll find me waiting for you
under the marquee.

18
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,689
Raymond?

19
00:00:38,758 --> 00:00:40,657
Anne, I am so terribly sorry.

20
00:00:40,726 --> 00:00:43,293
I'm afraid I'm not gonna
be able to make it tonight.

21
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:49,189
Your position in commodities is strong.

22
00:00:49,214 --> 00:00:50,514
Copper, gold.

23
00:00:50,669 --> 00:00:52,536
But the real returns
have been in crypto.

24
00:00:52,912 --> 00:00:56,146
As you can see, year-to-date,
bitcoin has an 800% return.

25
00:00:56,275 --> 00:00:58,142
Your insistence on taking
a large position

26
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,793
was insanely prescient.

27
00:01:00,312 --> 00:01:02,813
Must be nice, being so rich that
getting richer bores you.

28
00:01:02,882 --> 00:01:05,516
I'm not bored.
I'm just... anxious to leave.

29
00:01:05,584 --> 00:01:07,017
We have another appointment.

30
00:01:07,042 --> 00:01:08,808
An appointment I'm a little
bit more concerned about

31
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:11,133
than the... state of my liquidity.

32
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:12,724
We're running late.

33
00:01:12,925 --> 00:01:14,458
What do you know about bridge?

34
00:01:14,527 --> 00:01:17,227
The game, not the way
to cross from here to there.

35
00:01:17,296 --> 00:01:19,863
Bridge? I don't... I-I'm sorry.

36
00:01:19,932 --> 00:01:21,865
I was under the impression that
a comprehensive review of your

37
00:01:21,934 --> 00:01:23,934
investments and holdings was of
the utmost importance

38
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:25,636
- at this time?
- It is.

39
00:01:25,704 --> 00:01:28,071
We anticipate a significant
increase in our need

40
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,674
for available resources
over the next few months.

41
00:01:30,743 --> 00:01:32,176
Well, there you have it.

42
00:01:32,244 --> 00:01:35,179
We all have different interests
and priorities, don't we?

43
00:01:35,247 --> 00:01:38,148
For instance, in the morning,
Mr. Zuma likes to start with

44
00:01:38,217 --> 00:01:40,317
the business section
then move on to the sports.

45
00:01:40,386 --> 00:01:43,020
I like to start with the funnies
and fall asleep in my chair.

46
00:01:43,088 --> 00:01:44,555
Takes me all day to read the paper.

47
00:01:44,623 --> 00:01:45,923
- I like the funnies.
- No, I...

48
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:47,658
He likes the funnies, as well,
but he also has

49
00:01:47,726 --> 00:01:49,726
an amazing head for business.

50
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:51,929
Numbers and trends and,
you know, all the rest of it.

51
00:01:51,997 --> 00:01:54,364
Whereas I wouldn't know
a bitcoin from a subway token.

52
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:55,632
Well, you wouldn't have to.

53
00:01:55,701 --> 00:01:57,935
Uh, bitcoins aren't a tangible thing.

54
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:02,039
They aren't? I wouldn't know.

55
00:02:02,107 --> 00:02:03,640
My investment in bitcoin

56
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:05,642
was neither prescient nor insane.

57
00:02:05,711 --> 00:02:08,345
I was just following
Mr. Nakamoto's instructions.

58
00:02:08,414 --> 00:02:09,980
Satoshi said buy, I bought.

59
00:02:10,049 --> 00:02:12,249
Satoshi Nakamoto? You know him?

60
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:14,017
Who... Who he really is?

61
00:02:14,086 --> 00:02:15,752
Yes, well, Dembe knows him
better than I.

62
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:17,120
They're like, you know...

63
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:19,256
I-Is there anything else
we need to review?

64
00:02:19,325 --> 00:02:20,757
We do have a plane to catch.

65
00:02:20,782 --> 00:02:22,849
Uh, well, there's your holdings

66
00:02:22,962 --> 00:02:26,396
in Singapore and the BSE, but...

67
00:02:26,421 --> 00:02:27,720
I-I'm sorry. You know Nakamoto?

68
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:30,100
The Nakamoto? No one knows Nakamoto.

69
00:02:30,169 --> 00:02:31,969
Mr. Cane, we really must be going,

70
00:02:32,037 --> 00:02:33,837
which means you need to be going.

71
00:02:33,906 --> 00:02:36,139
Okay, well, if there's anything
else I can help you with...

72
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,708
Not unless you know something about

73
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:39,935
bidding or suit management.

74
00:02:40,713 --> 00:02:42,079
Bridge.

75
00:02:42,147 --> 00:02:43,881
No.

76
00:02:46,692 --> 00:02:49,119
Can I tell you what I'm concerned about?

77
00:02:49,188 --> 00:02:50,287
Townsend...

78
00:02:50,356 --> 00:02:52,289
Oh, I am so confused.

79
00:02:52,358 --> 00:02:55,659
The more I read, the less
I understand this game.

80
00:02:55,728 --> 00:02:58,495
...and that I'm not
going to be there with you.

81
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:02,683
Raymond, I'm serious.

82
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,608
I know, and I love that about you.

83
00:03:04,904 --> 00:03:07,045
But I'll be fine. I...

84
00:03:08,073 --> 00:03:08,964
I'll be fine.

85
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:12,089
No patterns. You taught me that.

86
00:03:12,478 --> 00:03:14,011
You said it's the first rule

87
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:16,914
of staying a step ahead of your enemies.

88
00:03:16,982 --> 00:03:19,883
Do something once, it may go undetected.

89
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:20,951
Maybe twice.

90
00:03:21,226 --> 00:03:23,654
After that, it's a pattern.

91
00:03:24,313 --> 00:03:26,140
How many visits will this be?

92
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:27,482
Five.

93
00:03:32,731 --> 00:03:34,464
I like her.

94
00:03:35,198 --> 00:03:37,834
I like coming home to a port.

95
00:03:37,903 --> 00:03:39,970
Seeing a candle burning in a window.

96
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:42,439
A smiling face waiting to greet me.

97
00:03:42,508 --> 00:03:45,609
I... I never liked it before.

98
00:03:45,634 --> 00:03:47,233
I like it now.

99
00:03:51,383 --> 00:03:55,652
Did you know that irises are
the state flower of Tennessee?

100
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:57,688
What's the state flower of Kansas?

101
00:03:57,756 --> 00:03:59,306
The sunflower.

102
00:03:59,892 --> 00:04:02,726
She grew up with them. She likes irises.

103
00:04:02,982 --> 00:04:05,115
I should be with you.

104
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,067
You should be with Raymond Reddington.

105
00:04:11,337 --> 00:04:13,670
When I'm with Anne, that's not who I am.

106
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,239
It may not be who you want to be,

107
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,201
but it's always who you are.

108
00:04:24,172 --> 00:04:25,772
So much for the sexiest man alive.

109
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,224
- Down, girl.
- I'm just saying,

110
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,720
I like punctuality.

111
00:04:29,788 --> 00:04:31,188
Maybe his plane was delayed.

112
00:04:31,256 --> 00:04:32,756
So, why hasn't he called yet?

113
00:04:32,825 --> 00:04:35,225
Only because I like to make
a dramatic entrance.

114
00:04:35,294 --> 00:04:37,894
Raymond! Irises!

115
00:04:38,637 --> 00:04:40,764
- Oh, you're so sweet.
- Mm.

116
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,299
Promise me you'll play nice.

117
00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:45,969
What are you talking about?
I'm a total softie.

118
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:48,972
I'll put these in water
and make you a sandwich.

119
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,540
You remember Bran and Lois.

120
00:04:50,609 --> 00:04:53,777
Yes, of course. Hello, Bran, Lois.

121
00:04:53,846 --> 00:04:55,045
- Hello, Ray!
- Hello!

122
00:04:55,114 --> 00:04:57,481
I hope you'll go easy on me tonight.

123
00:04:57,549 --> 00:04:58,915
You'll do fine. Gin and tonic?

124
00:04:58,984 --> 00:05:01,518
Yes! We've gotten a head start.

125
00:05:01,587 --> 00:05:02,819
I'm sure I'll catch up.

126
00:05:02,888 --> 00:05:04,855
I'm not so sure you will.

127
00:05:04,923 --> 00:05:08,025
Oh. Need a refill.

128
00:05:09,628 --> 00:05:11,044
Lois.

129
00:05:12,398 --> 00:05:13,930
So, flight delayed?

130
00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:18,001
Yes. Seems to be the norm nowadays.

131
00:05:19,371 --> 00:05:21,571
Anne is very trusting.

132
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,306
She thinks because
we live in a small town,

133
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,409
she's got nothing to be afraid of.

134
00:05:25,477 --> 00:05:27,744
It's why she leaves her door unlocked.

135
00:05:27,813 --> 00:05:29,361
It wasn't unlocked just now.

136
00:05:29,435 --> 00:05:31,348
Really? Then how'd you get in?

137
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:33,108
Anne gave me a key.

138
00:05:34,953 --> 00:05:36,453
Look.

139
00:05:36,522 --> 00:05:38,455
I'm Annie's best friend.

140
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,447
- Yes.
- I want her to be happy.

141
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:43,260
That makes two of us.

142
00:05:43,328 --> 00:05:46,863
Good, because if you mess
this up, I'm gonna kill you.

143
00:05:52,134 --> 00:06:00,142
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

144
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,246
Pass.

145
00:06:03,315 --> 00:06:05,415
Anyone for Go Fish?

146
00:06:05,484 --> 00:06:06,983
That's not a bid.

147
00:06:07,052 --> 00:06:08,672
You're right. It's a cry for help.

148
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:10,821
- You can't make a bid?
- How about Crazy Eights?

149
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:12,489
No? Okay.

150
00:06:12,514 --> 00:06:15,275
I bid... one heart?

151
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:16,960
One heart.

152
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:18,488
- That'll do.
- Two diamonds.

153
00:06:18,568 --> 00:06:19,629
Two spades.

154
00:06:19,698 --> 00:06:22,165
- Pass.
- Pass, I think.

155
00:06:22,234 --> 00:06:23,800
- Pass.
- Jack of hearts.

156
00:06:23,869 --> 00:06:25,902
Ah. And now it's my turn again?

157
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:27,604
No. Now you're the dummy.

158
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:30,373
- That's a bit harsh.
- Your hand is the dummy.

159
00:06:30,442 --> 00:06:32,642
- Lay your cards down, face up.
- Thank you.

160
00:06:32,711 --> 00:06:34,544
I'm your partner. When you're the dummy,

161
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:37,147
you say "good luck" back to me.
It's tradition.

162
00:06:37,216 --> 00:06:38,815
Well, good luck, good lookin'.

163
00:06:40,052 --> 00:06:41,952
Now you can go get yourself
a piece of that cake

164
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,453
before I eat it all.

165
00:06:43,522 --> 00:06:45,655
Much to everyone's relief.

166
00:06:45,724 --> 00:06:47,023
Kick some ass.

167
00:06:47,771 --> 00:06:50,360
So, Lois, what's it like
to be a police officer

168
00:06:50,429 --> 00:06:51,755
in a small town?

169
00:06:51,816 --> 00:06:54,531
I ask because I'm something
of a true-crime buff.

170
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,932
You are? So am I!

171
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:58,401
I like the podcasts and
the documentaries on Netflix.

172
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:02,072
Yes! I love those.
I loved "The Staircase."

173
00:07:02,141 --> 00:07:03,673
- Oh.
- Queen of hearts from dummy.

174
00:07:03,742 --> 00:07:05,408
And I love reading them, too.

175
00:07:05,477 --> 00:07:08,465
I first got hooked on "In Cold Blood,"

176
00:07:08,549 --> 00:07:10,046
then "Executioner's Song."

177
00:07:10,115 --> 00:07:12,382
Ooh, I can take that. Ace of hearts.

178
00:07:12,451 --> 00:07:15,285
- I haven't read that one, Ray.
- Oh, you should. Norman Mailer.

179
00:07:15,354 --> 00:07:17,220
Nothing like that goes on around here.

180
00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:19,890
Thank goodness.
It's a pretty quiet town.

181
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,025
I've got a gun, but I've never used it.

182
00:07:22,094 --> 00:07:23,693
I can't imagine I ever would.

183
00:07:23,762 --> 00:07:26,696
Mmm. Smart and sweet and funny...

184
00:07:26,765 --> 00:07:27,898
and she bakes.

185
00:07:27,966 --> 00:07:29,900
I wish.

186
00:07:29,968 --> 00:07:31,434
Cindi made that and brought it over

187
00:07:31,503 --> 00:07:33,670
after we had that fender bender
in the parking lot.

188
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:35,939
That's how you say
you're sorry in a small town.

189
00:07:36,008 --> 00:07:38,675
Well, bless Cindi's heart.
And her frosting.

190
00:07:38,744 --> 00:07:40,710
- Six of clubs.
- King of clubs.

191
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:41,978
Seven of clubs.

192
00:07:42,047 --> 00:07:43,246
Tell me how you two met again.

193
00:07:43,315 --> 00:07:44,915
9 of clubs from the dummy.

194
00:07:44,983 --> 00:07:46,917
Because it clearly wasn't
at a bridge tournament.

195
00:07:48,275 --> 00:07:49,719
We met in the park.

196
00:07:49,788 --> 00:07:52,422
Anne was watching birds.
I was watching Anne.

197
00:07:52,491 --> 00:07:54,958
We bonded over a Cape May Warbler.

198
00:07:55,027 --> 00:07:58,028
Then he asked me to go see
"North by Northwest"

199
00:07:58,096 --> 00:07:59,503
and promptly stood me up.

200
00:07:59,557 --> 00:08:02,332
But he's more than made up
for that since.

201
00:08:02,401 --> 00:08:06,303
We've been having an ongoing
classic-film festival.

202
00:08:06,371 --> 00:08:08,338
We started with movies
with musical numbers.

203
00:08:08,407 --> 00:08:10,874
He's usually asleep
long before the end credits.

204
00:08:10,943 --> 00:08:12,242
Not tonight.

205
00:08:12,311 --> 00:08:16,746
Tonight, we start on
Italian cinema from the 1960s.

206
00:08:16,815 --> 00:08:18,081
Oh, g...

207
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:22,419
No one can sleep through
that zeitgeist of cool.

208
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,921
Not even the dummy.

209
00:08:47,512 --> 00:08:48,762
Ah.

210
00:08:49,381 --> 00:08:52,916
I'm gonna have to re-solder
a wire on the output connector

211
00:08:52,985 --> 00:08:55,143
for this turntable to work.

212
00:08:55,621 --> 00:08:58,041
I don't suppose you have
a soldering iron, do you?

213
00:08:58,103 --> 00:08:59,789
Uh, no.

214
00:09:01,816 --> 00:09:04,761
You know what? I think I'm gonna
run down to the hardware store

215
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,997
and see if I can pick one up.

216
00:09:07,065 --> 00:09:08,565
Take the truck.

217
00:09:08,634 --> 00:09:10,700
You don't want to waste gas
on your rental.

218
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:12,002
You know where the keys are.

219
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,704
I'll have us dancing in no time.

220
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,007
- Mm.
- Mm. Mm.

221
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,743
What?

222
00:09:19,811 --> 00:09:21,811
- Nothing.
- No, no, no. What, what?

223
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,614
I'm a straight-as-an-arrow 52-year-old.

224
00:09:24,683 --> 00:09:26,483
I was married to one man,

225
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:29,619
my high-school sweetheart, for 25 years.

226
00:09:29,688 --> 00:09:33,807
I'm in a book club.
I go to church on Sundays.

227
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:36,826
And somehow, I'm in
a relationship with someone

228
00:09:36,895 --> 00:09:39,729
who when he says the words
"output connector"...

229
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:43,767
...all I can think about is sex.

230
00:09:43,835 --> 00:09:45,201
That's what I'm always thinking about

231
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,778
when I say "output connector."

232
00:09:59,674 --> 00:10:01,240
No patterns.

233
00:10:01,353 --> 00:10:03,320
You said it's the first rule of

234
00:10:03,388 --> 00:10:05,655
staying a step ahead of your enemies.

235
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:26,465

But you're busy at work.

242
00:10:39,825 --> 00:10:41,891
This is a particularly...

243
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,893
fraught time.

244
00:10:43,962 --> 00:10:45,628
"Fraught."

245
00:10:46,465 --> 00:10:49,666

That must be very hard. I'm sorry.

250
00:11:02,681 --> 00:11:05,081
Is there anything I can do to help you?

251
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,050
You're already doing it.

252
00:11:07,075 --> 00:11:09,375
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

253
00:11:09,488 --> 00:11:13,790
Out there, my life is so complicated.

254
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,534
And here, it's not.

255
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,928
I want to do more

256
00:11:18,997 --> 00:11:21,931
than help you set aside your burdens.

257
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,459
I want to help you carry them.

258
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:27,879
I can't do that unless
you tell me what they are.

259
00:11:29,441 --> 00:11:30,840
Anne.

260
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:32,509
What?

261
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:36,429

I'm just saying I wouldn't mind.

272
00:13:01,106 --> 00:13:03,907
Because he likes true
crime? I like true crime.

273
00:13:03,975 --> 00:13:07,043
All I'm saying is you know
next to nothing about him.

274
00:13:07,112 --> 00:13:09,646
I know... a lot.

275
00:13:11,116 --> 00:13:13,449
I know how he makes me feel.

276
00:13:13,518 --> 00:13:16,252
I know he's got a business
and it's got problems.

277
00:13:16,321 --> 00:13:18,922
And I know when he's here,
those problems go away.

278
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,024
What business? What problems?

279
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,993
I know, I know.
I'm the overprotective friend

280
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:25,962
who should mind her own business.

281
00:13:26,031 --> 00:13:29,199
I'm just saying, I have never
met anyone from New York

282
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:32,936
who wasn't either pushy, rude,
or a complete narcissist.

283
00:13:33,004 --> 00:13:35,271
Well, first of all,
he's not from New York.

284
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,474
And, Lois, to the world, I'm invisible,

285
00:13:38,543 --> 00:13:39,842
but not to him.

286
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:42,445
He sees me, and I love him for it.

287
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,737
I do. I love him.

288
00:13:48,811 --> 00:13:50,740
Does he know about the love part?

289
00:13:50,778 --> 00:13:52,012
No.

290
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:53,942
He does now.

291
00:13:54,859 --> 00:13:56,759
Good morning, ladies.

292
00:13:56,828 --> 00:13:59,929
That coffee smells delicious.

293
00:13:59,998 --> 00:14:01,798
Good morning.

294
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,955
Hungry? I brought muffins.

295
00:14:06,008 --> 00:14:07,270
Thank you, Lois!

296
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:11,507
But I prefer cereal,
the breakfast of narcissists.

297
00:14:11,576 --> 00:14:15,979
So we can gaze admiringly at
our reflection in the spoon.

298
00:14:16,004 --> 00:14:18,805
I better get on into the station.

299
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,418
Sorry.

300
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,058
Goodbye, Lois.

301
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:38,027
Have I told you about
the fork-tailed flycatcher?

302
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,187
She's right.

303
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,672
How they gather near
the elm trees south of town?

304
00:14:42,741 --> 00:14:45,041
You know almost nothing about me.

305
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,010
I know everything I need to know...

306
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:50,046
Unless, of course,
those "business problems"

307
00:14:50,071 --> 00:14:52,871
are a euphemism for a wife
or a husband somewhere.

308
00:14:52,984 --> 00:14:54,751
No wife. No husband.

309
00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:57,120
But there is a cat.

310
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:01,050
As well as other things
you should know about me.

311
00:15:01,593 --> 00:15:02,825
About who I am.

312
00:15:02,894 --> 00:15:05,888
Raymond. I know who you are.

313
00:15:06,231 --> 00:15:09,799
You're someone who needs to see
the fork-tailed flycatcher.

314
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,734
Which I intend to show you,

315
00:15:11,803 --> 00:15:15,150
just as soon as I find my binoculars.

316
00:15:15,227 --> 00:15:16,506
I'm gonna go upstairs,

317
00:15:16,892 --> 00:15:19,442
and you're gonna make us
some sandwiches to take with.

318
00:15:19,511 --> 00:15:20,743
How's that sound?

319
00:15:20,812 --> 00:15:22,712
It sounds just right.

320
00:15:30,655 --> 00:15:33,056
I found two pairs and a blanket.

321
00:15:33,124 --> 00:15:35,291
I found salami and cheese.

322
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,461
I'll get a basket for the food,
and we're good to go.

323
00:15:38,525 --> 00:15:40,296
You told me the flycatcher

324
00:15:40,365 --> 00:15:44,801
can range as far south as lower Mexico,

325
00:15:44,869 --> 00:15:49,439
and some have even been spotted
as far down as Argentina.

326
00:15:49,507 --> 00:15:50,873
What was that?

327
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,042
Nothing. I was just...

328
00:15:58,817 --> 00:16:00,483
What were you saying?

329
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,186
I was saying... I was remembering

330
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:07,857
that you said you were thinking
about becoming a vegetarian.

331
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:10,393
That pipe dream was about 12 pounds ago.

332
00:16:10,462 --> 00:16:13,229
That's something my doctor
is always bugging me about.

333
00:16:13,298 --> 00:16:15,298
Didn't you say there was an excellent

334
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:17,433
vegan sandwich shop in town?

335
00:16:17,502 --> 00:16:20,203
- But you're already making lunch.
- Which we can bring,

336
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:23,373
in case the tofurkey is inedible.

337
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:27,110
Why don't you run into town,
order for both of us?

338
00:16:27,178 --> 00:16:30,947
I'll finish up, pack, and be
ready to go when you get back.

339
00:16:31,015 --> 00:16:33,201
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

340
00:16:33,918 --> 00:16:37,653
Okay. Two tofurkey sandwiches comin' up.

341
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,692
Oh. Hey, there.

342
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:19,061
Hey. Here on a call. Won't be long.

343
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:22,064
A call? Really?
What seems to be the problem?

344
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:24,133
County sent me.
Area's been having outages.

345
00:17:24,202 --> 00:17:26,502
I just gotta check your
ground wires. It's standard.

346
00:17:26,571 --> 00:17:28,271
Okay. Very good.

347
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,139
Vague, but detailed enough.

348
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,041
Delivered with authority.

349
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,709
I'm not sure what you mean.

350
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,080
You know what I mean.

351
00:17:36,548 --> 00:17:39,549
Listen, mister, if it helps, I
got the work order right here.

352
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:42,585
Great.

353
00:17:42,654 --> 00:17:44,320
Ugh!

354
00:17:45,423 --> 00:17:47,890
How many are coming?

355
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:51,294
Everyone.

356
00:18:54,075 --> 00:18:55,633
You found Arkham.

357
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,453
In a chest freezer in the garage.

358
00:18:57,741 --> 00:18:58,969
His weapon's gone, vehicle's gone.

359
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:01,322
The girlfriend, Miss Foster.
Ping her cell.

360
00:19:01,347 --> 00:19:03,043
She left less than 20 minutes ago.

361
00:19:03,068 --> 00:19:04,815
Reddington wasn't far behind.

362
00:19:04,884 --> 00:19:07,017
Wherever she's going,
that's where he's going.

363
00:19:07,086 --> 00:19:11,092
Copy that. What do you want to
do about the missing vehicle?

364
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:20,197
Reddington.

365
00:19:20,266 --> 00:19:22,133
This is between you and me.

366
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:23,968
It has nothing to do with her.

367
00:19:24,036 --> 00:19:25,836
You must be referring to Miss Foster.

368
00:19:25,905 --> 00:19:28,205
She has no idea who I am.

369
00:19:28,274 --> 00:19:29,840
My family had no idea who you were.

370
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:32,456
They didn't know why they were
singled out or targeted,

371
00:19:32,481 --> 00:19:34,614
but that didn't prevent their suffering.

372
00:19:34,683 --> 00:19:37,818
You still have time to rethink
this. It's not too late.

373
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,820
It's interesting to me
how you speak as if you have

374
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:42,289
any say in how this
will end for you, Raymond...

375
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,480
as if it can somehow
be resolved in a civil manner.

376
00:19:44,505 --> 00:19:46,739
The one thing I can assure you of...

377
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:50,230
The one thing... is that
what is about to happen

378
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:52,532
is going to be anything but civil.

379
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,570
They got a track on the woman's cell.

380
00:19:56,638 --> 00:19:58,071
She's close.

381
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:00,016
I have a second team
on their way to her now.

382
00:20:12,287 --> 00:20:13,820
- Anne.
- Hey. What are you doing here?

383
00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:16,023
If you needed something else,
you could've called me.

384
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:17,524
I need you to come with me.

385
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:20,161
Is that blood on your hand?
What happened?

386
00:20:20,282 --> 00:20:21,615
I'll explain in the car.

387
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:27,467
Raymond, are you okay? I-I don't...

388
00:20:27,536 --> 00:20:29,870
What's... What's going on?

389
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,634
Stay with me.

390
00:20:38,847 --> 00:20:40,781
Raymond, please, where are we going?

391
00:20:40,849 --> 00:20:42,883
- Give me your phone.
- Raymond, what on earth is wrong?

392
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:46,420
- Your phone, please.
- Raymond, you're scaring me.

393
00:20:46,488 --> 00:20:49,589
What's going on? And who's that woman?

394
00:20:57,234 --> 00:20:58,407
Here.

395
00:21:00,899 --> 00:21:02,836
Hello. Can I help you?

396
00:21:05,507 --> 00:21:07,371
- You should leave.
- Is that a gun?!

397
00:21:07,396 --> 00:21:09,042
Raymond!

398
00:21:09,178 --> 00:21:10,644
Here. Come with me.

399
00:21:10,712 --> 00:21:13,313
No! Answer my question!
What is going on?

400
00:21:13,382 --> 00:21:14,815
I'm not who you think I am.

401
00:21:14,883 --> 00:21:17,451
I have another life, and
that life found us here today.

402
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:19,786
We are in danger, and
I need to keep you safe...

403
00:21:19,855 --> 00:21:21,455
Someone wants to hurt you?

404
00:21:21,523 --> 00:21:23,224
They want to hurt us.

405
00:21:24,626 --> 00:21:27,080
Here. Stay here. Stay quiet.

406
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,229
Only open the door if it's me.

407
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:31,421
Anyone else, shoot. Do you understand?

408
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:34,935
Just point and pull the trigger.

409
00:22:24,853 --> 00:22:26,506
- Anne.
- Raymond.

410
00:22:26,576 --> 00:22:28,472
- W-What did you do?
- We have to go.

411
00:22:29,591 --> 00:22:31,625
Who was that woman?

412
00:22:31,693 --> 00:22:34,728
- Please, just try and keep up.
- Where are you taking me?

413
00:22:34,796 --> 00:22:37,864
I don't want... stop! Let go of my hand!

414
00:22:37,933 --> 00:22:40,867
Anne, please. Listen to me.
There are people coming for us.

415
00:22:40,936 --> 00:22:43,937
It's not safe. You need to come with me.

416
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:45,728
Come with you where?

417
00:22:54,316 --> 00:22:56,255
Officers, may I have
your attention, please?

418
00:22:56,303 --> 00:22:58,385
- I'm sorry to interrupt.
- What are you two doing here?

419
00:22:58,453 --> 00:22:59,807
May I please have your attention?

420
00:22:59,832 --> 00:23:02,159
- My name is Raymond Reddington.
- Listen to what he has to say.

421
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:05,559
I'm a wanted fugitive. I have
two firearms on my person.

422
00:23:05,627 --> 00:23:07,961
- Gun!
- Someone will need to disarm me.

423
00:23:09,065 --> 00:23:10,764
Lois, we have a situation.

424
00:23:10,966 --> 00:23:13,542
I need you to listen to me
very carefully.

425
00:23:21,129 --> 00:23:23,228
Chief! Agent Barnes again on three.

426
00:23:23,262 --> 00:23:25,028
- Says they have confirmation.
- Agents en route?

427
00:23:25,097 --> 00:23:26,563
In the air now. 40 minutes out.

428
00:23:26,632 --> 00:23:29,199
Within 40 minutes, everyone in
this building could be dead.

429
00:23:29,268 --> 00:23:30,567
You really are him.

430
00:23:30,636 --> 00:23:33,704
Lois, you need
to get her somewhere safe.

431
00:23:33,772 --> 00:23:35,666
Now. We don't have much time.

432
00:23:35,716 --> 00:23:37,721
You need to contact the highway patrol

433
00:23:37,771 --> 00:23:40,344
and sheriff's department
and any available units

434
00:23:40,412 --> 00:23:42,412
- from other counties.
- Can someone shut him up?

435
00:23:42,481 --> 00:23:45,515
Chief, I got someone from the
D.C. field office on line two.

436
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,806
They are coming here.

437
00:23:46,831 --> 00:23:48,664
Dangerous, highly trained mercenaries.

438
00:23:48,821 --> 00:23:52,022
He's not making it up.
I saw him kill a woman.

439
00:23:52,091 --> 00:23:53,423
Kill who?

440
00:23:53,448 --> 00:23:55,215
Lois, look at me.

441
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,375
I am the most wanted man to
ever come through those doors...

442
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:01,498
By a lot... And I came here by choice,

443
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:04,134
not to surrender myself,
but to protect Anne

444
00:24:04,203 --> 00:24:07,170
from the very bad men who are coming.

445
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:09,172
You need to get her somewhere safe,

446
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:11,375
because they will not be
intimidated by the fact

447
00:24:11,443 --> 00:24:14,044
that you're the police.
They will assault this building

448
00:24:14,113 --> 00:24:16,313
and kill everyone inside to get to me.

449
00:24:16,382 --> 00:24:19,583
Please, get on the mutual-aid
band and scramble any units

450
00:24:19,652 --> 00:24:23,253
within earshot, because this
is happening right now.

451
00:24:23,322 --> 00:24:26,089
It isn't just Wichita
coming for you, friend.

452
00:24:26,158 --> 00:24:29,960
Kansas City suits are on
the way, a team out of D.C.

453
00:24:30,029 --> 00:24:32,496
Chief, will you take a look at this?

454
00:24:32,955 --> 00:24:35,499
Anne, talk to me. What do you
mean he killed someone?

455
00:24:35,567 --> 00:24:37,601
- Killed who?
- I don't know who she was.

456
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:38,936
You saw him do it?

457
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,804
Neither one has plates.

458
00:24:40,873 --> 00:24:42,839
You may want to get away
from those doors, Chief.

459
00:24:42,908 --> 00:24:45,742
- What is happening?
- They're here, aren't they?

460
00:24:45,811 --> 00:24:47,411
Lois, I am begging you.

461
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:50,147
You've got to get your boss
to enact lockdown protocols.

462
00:24:50,215 --> 00:24:52,582
Get on the radio,
whatever cavalry you have,

463
00:24:52,607 --> 00:24:54,493
call them in, now!

464
00:24:54,562 --> 00:24:56,820
She doesn't have
the authority to give that order,

465
00:24:56,889 --> 00:24:59,122
and you sure as hell
aren't authorized to give it.

466
00:24:59,191 --> 00:25:00,791
You need to get ahead of this, Chief.

467
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:04,795
Sir, he's right. Whatever
this is, we are not equipped.

468
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,803
Okay. Here's what we're gonna do.

469
00:25:12,871 --> 00:25:16,039
I want all nonessential
personnel out of the building.

470
00:25:16,064 --> 00:25:17,797
Beth, get the others
and go out the back.

471
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:21,411
Pembry, find out what units
County has in the area

472
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,403
- and where they are!
- Brandt, notify Butler

473
00:25:23,428 --> 00:25:27,426
and Lyon counties
and put local EMS on standby.

474
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,887
Who are you?

475
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:35,559
You need somewhere safe
where you can hide.

476
00:25:38,592 --> 00:25:39,963
That was Reeves.

477
00:25:39,988 --> 00:25:41,955
There was an incident in town,

478
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,847
but they have eyes on Reddington.

479
00:25:44,003 --> 00:25:45,202
What kind of incident?

480
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,504
Landon. She's gone.

481
00:25:47,573 --> 00:25:49,406
- And Reddington?
- He took the woman

482
00:25:49,475 --> 00:25:51,375
and went into the local police station.

483
00:25:51,443 --> 00:25:53,443
Ah. Raymond.

484
00:25:53,512 --> 00:25:55,125
You do keep things interesting.

485
00:25:55,177 --> 00:25:56,580
How you wanna handle this?

486
00:25:56,648 --> 00:25:59,683
Put Sagan on the police scanners
and have him give us a timeframe.

487
00:25:59,752 --> 00:26:03,120
If we're going to do this, it's
gonna have to happen fast...

488
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:05,055
and happen now.

489
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:07,090
I just spoke to County.

490
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:08,525
They're sending units now.

491
00:26:08,594 --> 00:26:10,494
Gonna take Anne to Emporia
and hold her there

492
00:26:10,562 --> 00:26:12,195
until we have a better handle on this.

493
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,031
You can't wait for units.

494
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:15,465
You need to get her out of here now.

495
00:26:15,513 --> 00:26:17,067
Feds are 20 minutes out.

496
00:26:17,092 --> 00:26:18,558
How could you not tell me?

497
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:21,471
I let you into my life, my home.

498
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,441
I never wanted to draw you
into my life, Anne.

499
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,743
I only wanted to escape into yours.

500
00:26:26,812 --> 00:26:28,445
How selfish...

501
00:26:28,514 --> 00:26:30,981
You getting involved with me
while knowing all of this

502
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,315
was hanging over us.

503
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:35,369
I let my feelings for you
cloud my judgment.

504
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:37,287
I am so sorry.

505
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,834
When this is over...

506
00:26:42,294 --> 00:26:43,961
so are we.

507
00:26:47,199 --> 00:26:49,066
Chief, take a look at this.

508
00:26:49,134 --> 00:26:52,235
That second SUV moved.
It repositioned around back.

509
00:26:52,304 --> 00:26:53,904
We have a third out front now.

510
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:14,791
Cottonwood Falls Police. Chief Russell.

511
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,493
Chief! How wonderful.

512
00:27:16,562 --> 00:27:18,295
I presume you're the man in charge.

513
00:27:18,363 --> 00:27:19,763
I am. Who is this?

514
00:27:19,832 --> 00:27:22,099
I am the one who is here
for Mr. Reddington.

515
00:27:22,167 --> 00:27:25,001
I'm confident he's explained
the situation to you by now.

516
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:27,437
You also know the closest units
are nine minutes out,

517
00:27:27,506 --> 00:27:30,407
which gives me eight minutes
to acquire my prisoner.

518
00:27:30,476 --> 00:27:32,375
Send him out now, you live.

519
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:34,311
Surrender and walk away, you live.

520
00:27:34,379 --> 00:27:35,745
Stay and protect him,

521
00:27:35,814 --> 00:27:38,582
and we kill everyone
who stands in our path.

522
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,784
You have 60 seconds to send him out.

523
00:27:40,853 --> 00:27:44,121
Okay. Hold on. Let... Let's
start with who am I speaking to?

524
00:27:44,189 --> 00:27:45,555
Fifty-five.

525
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:51,919
- Chief?
- Fifty.

526
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,263
These guys are heavily armed.

527
00:27:53,332 --> 00:27:54,664
They're surrounding the facility.

528
00:27:54,733 --> 00:27:56,207
Hold on. L-Look. Anne, get down.

529
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:59,636
Why don't I come outside and we
can talk, have a conversation?

530
00:27:59,705 --> 00:28:01,455
Forty-five.

531
00:28:04,243 --> 00:28:06,676
You still there? Can you hear me?

532
00:28:06,745 --> 00:28:08,545
Look. I don't care who you are.

533
00:28:08,614 --> 00:28:10,280
I'm not gonna bend to your demands,

534
00:28:10,349 --> 00:28:12,616
and I'm certainly not gonna
send a man to his death,

535
00:28:12,684 --> 00:28:14,584
even if he is a known criminal.

536
00:28:14,653 --> 00:28:17,154
What I will do is talk to you
until we come up with

537
00:28:17,222 --> 00:28:18,822
some reasonable compro...

538
00:28:18,891 --> 00:28:20,724
Chief!

539
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,230
That was unfortunate.

540
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:29,166
But let's hope whoever
is second-in-command

541
00:28:29,234 --> 00:28:31,067
can be more reasonable.

542
00:28:31,136 --> 00:28:32,869
Send out Reddington.

543
00:28:33,654 --> 00:28:35,447
Now you're in charge.

544
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:44,389
Shots fired. Repeat. Shots fired.

545
00:28:44,414 --> 00:28:46,491
We have active shooters
on site. Officer down.

546
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,159
Requesting backup.

547
00:28:50,263 --> 00:28:52,463
We got state troopers
east of Elmdale headed our way.

548
00:28:52,532 --> 00:28:54,198
County units are still
eight minutes out.

549
00:28:54,267 --> 00:28:56,300
If you have a weapons cache, open it.

550
00:28:56,369 --> 00:28:59,502
We need to take positions
and push them back now.

551
00:28:59,527 --> 00:29:01,660
- I'm not giving you a weapon.
- Staying alive until

552
00:29:01,729 --> 00:29:04,196
backup arrives is
the only thing you can do.

553
00:29:04,221 --> 00:29:06,755
No. You know what I can do?

554
00:29:06,868 --> 00:29:08,501
End this by giving them what they want.

555
00:29:08,569 --> 00:29:09,935
- What does that mean?
- Look. Stop!

556
00:29:10,004 --> 00:29:12,004
We're not sending him
out there to be massacred.

557
00:29:12,073 --> 00:29:13,639
- I am not protecting him!
- Hold on!

558
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:15,441
- Keep your heads down.
- She's right, Brandt.

559
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,176
We can't send him out there.
They'll kill him.

560
00:29:17,245 --> 00:29:19,578
- Just let me think this through.
- What is there to think about?!

561
00:29:19,647 --> 00:29:21,947
I am not dying for him.
The Chief already did that.

562
00:29:22,016 --> 00:29:24,250
- Brandt, stop!
- Do not go out that door.

563
00:29:24,318 --> 00:29:25,718
I'm coming out!

564
00:29:27,121 --> 00:29:28,542
I'm unarmed!

565
00:29:29,423 --> 00:29:31,190
You can see that, right?

566
00:29:31,795 --> 00:29:33,338
No games.

567
00:29:33,861 --> 00:29:35,632
I just want to walk away.

568
00:29:36,427 --> 00:29:38,831
Oh!

569
00:29:44,105 --> 00:29:45,804
That man has two children!

570
00:29:45,873 --> 00:29:48,807
I thought police understood
rules. I told you the rules.

571
00:29:48,876 --> 00:29:50,292
You don't get to change your mind.

572
00:29:50,317 --> 00:29:52,611
I gave you 60 seconds
to send Reddington out.

573
00:29:52,747 --> 00:29:54,847
You ignored me, so now I'm coming in.

574
00:29:54,916 --> 00:29:58,317
The only thing that can stop
that is sending Reddington out.

575
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:05,269
No?

576
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,623
Okay. Be right there.

577
00:30:08,188 --> 00:30:09,420
You need to uncuff me.

578
00:30:09,445 --> 00:30:12,045
Lois, I can give them what they want.

579
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,503
You need to uncuff me.

580
00:30:13,768 --> 00:30:16,357
I'll uncuff you, but
you're not going out there.

581
00:30:16,457 --> 00:30:17,892
No. What are you doing? You can't!

582
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:19,790
Annie, he's Raymond Reddington.

583
00:30:19,907 --> 00:30:23,342
If we're gonna survive this,
he's the only chance we've got.

584
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:25,534
I'm removing these cuffs,
but so help me God,

585
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:28,327
if we get out of here alive,
I am arresting you.

586
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,619
If you try to escape, I'll
shoot you. Do you understand?

587
00:30:30,711 --> 00:30:33,145
Given the circumstances,
that's not much of a threat.

588
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:35,336
But, yes, I understand.

589
00:30:36,457 --> 00:30:38,390
Maybe we should give Anne a sidearm.

590
00:30:38,459 --> 00:30:40,893
- I don't want one.
- It could save your life.

591
00:30:40,962 --> 00:30:42,428
Give it to her.

592
00:30:42,496 --> 00:30:44,897
This is for our defense only.

593
00:30:44,966 --> 00:30:47,433
If this building is breached,
and only if it's breached,

594
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:49,468
you have my authorization to...

595
00:30:56,277 --> 00:30:58,744
Chase County Sheriff,
this is Officer Ethan Pembry.

596
00:30:58,813 --> 00:31:01,113
How far are those units?

597
00:31:02,984 --> 00:31:06,452
The detention cell!
Is it fully enclosed?

598
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,821
It is, but we can't access it!

599
00:31:08,889 --> 00:31:11,123
- What? Why not?
- I don't have the keys.

600
00:31:11,192 --> 00:31:12,980
- Brandt does.
- Brandt?

601
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,796
- I can get them.
- No, no, no!

602
00:31:17,865 --> 00:31:19,298
- We have to!
- It's too dangerous!

603
00:31:19,367 --> 00:31:21,100
No, Lois! No!

604
00:31:31,646 --> 00:31:33,345
No, no, no!

605
00:31:35,249 --> 00:31:36,949
Aah!

606
00:31:41,656 --> 00:31:43,922
Get her to the holding cell.

607
00:32:06,366 --> 00:32:08,299
There we go.

608
00:32:18,893 --> 00:32:20,859
Keys. Where are the keys?

609
00:32:22,997 --> 00:32:24,863
Here. Here.

610
00:32:29,036 --> 00:32:30,369
Okay.

611
00:32:51,058 --> 00:32:54,293
Well. Look what we have here.

612
00:32:54,361 --> 00:32:55,527
Three ducks in a barrel.

613
00:32:55,596 --> 00:32:58,163
Anne. Keep your eyes on Lois.

614
00:32:59,406 --> 00:33:00,699
Get the door off.

615
00:33:05,072 --> 00:33:06,638
Just ignore him.

616
00:33:06,707 --> 00:33:10,909
Heh! This certainly is interesting.

617
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,447
Give me your scarf.

618
00:33:22,823 --> 00:33:24,289
Mr. Reddington!

619
00:33:24,358 --> 00:33:25,958
Take her hand.

620
00:33:27,906 --> 00:33:29,574
Hello?

621
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:39,958
You should have left her
out of this, Neville.

622
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:42,207
It's over.

623
00:33:42,276 --> 00:33:43,809
This was between us.

624
00:33:43,878 --> 00:33:45,978
You're coming with me, Raymond.

625
00:33:46,046 --> 00:33:48,447
We're ending this today. Here.

626
00:33:48,516 --> 00:33:52,050
Yes, I'd like to agree with you,
but then we'd both be wrong.

627
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:54,520
So, in turn, how about this...

628
00:33:54,588 --> 00:33:58,123
Take your men and your guns...

629
00:33:58,148 --> 00:34:00,782
and your bloodshed... and go.

630
00:34:01,314 --> 00:34:03,362
Then come find me when you're ready,

631
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,831
and I'll show you the proper way
to exact revenge.

632
00:34:07,601 --> 00:34:11,069
Sir? We need to go. Right now.

633
00:34:17,511 --> 00:34:19,791
The medics will be here any minute.

634
00:34:20,581 --> 00:34:23,181
- Keep pressure on the wound.
- Mm-hmm.

635
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:26,652
I'm sorry, Anne. I wish I
belonged here with you, but I don't.

636
00:34:29,924 --> 00:34:31,523
No. Stop.

637
00:34:31,592 --> 00:34:34,426
I told you if we survived this,
I'd arrest you.

638
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:36,508
You're under arrest.

639
00:35:01,888 --> 00:35:04,255
It's all right. You okay?

640
00:35:04,324 --> 00:35:06,391
Yeah.

641
00:35:06,459 --> 00:35:07,492
FBI.

642
00:35:09,596 --> 00:35:11,896
She needs a doctor.

643
00:35:11,965 --> 00:35:14,265
Station's clear. We need paramedics.

644
00:35:14,334 --> 00:35:16,901
- Did you find Reddington?
- He was here?

645
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,770
Clear!

646
00:35:19,539 --> 00:35:21,936
- I tried to stop him.
- You didn't find him?

647
00:35:21,961 --> 00:35:24,461
Not yet, but knowing he was
here, we'll drop a net so wide,

648
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,730
even he won't be able to escape.

649
00:35:29,249 --> 00:35:31,613
- Who did this?
- My friend.

650
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:34,338
I'm not sure where
you learned this, friend,

651
00:35:34,407 --> 00:35:36,466
but you saved her life.

652
00:35:37,285 --> 00:35:39,209
Reddington was in town visiting you?

653
00:35:39,278 --> 00:35:40,978
I didn't know who he was.

654
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:43,113
I'm told he came quite often.

655
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,548
That's right. He did.

656
00:35:45,043 --> 00:35:46,884
But you didn't know who he was?

657
00:35:47,753 --> 00:35:50,054
You mean, was my life so boring
that I was willing

658
00:35:50,122 --> 00:35:53,057
to spice it up by dating
an international fugitive?

659
00:35:53,082 --> 00:35:54,715
No. It was not.

660
00:35:54,827 --> 00:35:57,161
But it turns out it was boring
enough for me to get suckered

661
00:35:57,229 --> 00:36:00,564
by an international fugitive
into thinking he cared about me.

662
00:36:00,633 --> 00:36:02,933
Now that I know the truth, believe me,

663
00:36:03,002 --> 00:36:04,768
if I can help you find him,

664
00:36:05,188 --> 00:36:06,704
well, that would be my pleasure.

665
00:36:06,772 --> 00:36:08,972
Glad to hear it, because
I have a lot of questions.

666
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:11,508
And I'll answer every one,
but I need to go home first.

667
00:36:11,577 --> 00:36:13,310
One of my men will accompany you.

668
00:36:13,335 --> 00:36:15,135
She's a victim, not a suspect.

669
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:17,101
She's also my oldest friend.

670
00:36:17,144 --> 00:36:18,649
I don't want you hounding her.

671
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:22,052
I just need to shower, change,
and have a good cry.

672
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:25,389
And then I'll answer
anything you want to ask.

673
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:28,692
My car's in the lot.
Mind taking it home?

674
00:36:28,761 --> 00:36:30,661
Of course not. I'll be at the hospital

675
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,130
just as soon as I've answered
their questions.

676
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:34,798
I wish we'd caught him.

677
00:36:34,867 --> 00:36:37,568
But knowing he's out of your life,

678
00:36:37,636 --> 00:36:40,037
I do get some satisfaction in that.

679
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:46,944
I told you if we survived
this, I'd arrest you.

680
00:36:47,012 --> 00:36:48,579
You're under arrest.

681
00:36:48,647 --> 00:36:51,548
Anne watched you kill someone.
I saw you kill three more.

682
00:36:51,617 --> 00:36:53,751
We're alive because of that.

683
00:36:53,819 --> 00:36:56,960
Not my chief. Not Pembry or Brandt.

684
00:36:57,005 --> 00:36:58,489
They're dead because of you.

685
00:36:58,557 --> 00:37:01,291
I kept telling them
what they needed to do,

686
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,960
and they didn't do it.

687
00:37:03,028 --> 00:37:05,696
You were right. About him.

688
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,465
The wolf in sheep's clothing.
But you were wrong, too.

689
00:37:08,534 --> 00:37:11,702
- Anne, don't.
- You don't understand.

690
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:14,004
- You need to move!
- I can't.

691
00:37:14,424 --> 00:37:16,039
I won't.

692
00:37:39,899 --> 00:37:43,500
Lois said to take the Falls Road
east out of town.

693
00:37:43,569 --> 00:37:45,602
Most of the staties
don't even know it exists.

694
00:37:45,671 --> 00:37:48,138
Nobody will be watching.
She's a good friend.

695
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:49,918
The best.

696
00:37:50,843 --> 00:37:52,764
The man who came after you today...

697
00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:54,445
Neville Townsend.

698
00:37:54,513 --> 00:37:56,713
He won't stop, will he?

699
00:37:58,417 --> 00:38:01,096
You were right. At the station.

700
00:38:01,554 --> 00:38:03,487
Us, getting involved.

701
00:38:03,556 --> 00:38:05,389
It was selfish of me.

702
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:07,257
It put you in harm's way.

703
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:08,692
It still puts you there.

704
00:38:08,761 --> 00:38:10,394
If I'm in trouble either way,

705
00:38:10,463 --> 00:38:11,862
why can't we be together?

706
00:38:11,931 --> 00:38:14,565
Because what I have to do
and how I have to do it,

707
00:38:14,633 --> 00:38:16,433
you can't be a part of that.

708
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:18,425
No one should be a part of that.

709
00:38:26,078 --> 00:38:29,513
It won't be safe here until it's done.

710
00:38:29,582 --> 00:38:31,348
I understand.

711
00:38:31,417 --> 00:38:32,883
Is there somewhere you can go?

712
00:38:32,952 --> 00:38:35,619
And not to your daughter's.
They'll anticipate that.

713
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,555
My friend Cindi,
the one who made the cake.

714
00:38:38,624 --> 00:38:40,057
She has a cabin.

715
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:42,459
Call her. See if you can go there.

716
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:45,796
When it's safe,
you'll receive a postcard.

717
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:48,279
It'll be from the Corn Palace
in Mitchell, South Dakota.

718
00:38:48,361 --> 00:38:49,939
That's how you'll know it's me.

719
00:38:50,029 --> 00:38:52,636
But you don't know the address.

720
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,706
I have certain... capabilities.

721
00:38:56,234 --> 00:38:58,442
Too bad staying awake for
a movie isn't one of them.

722
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,365
Ahh...

723
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:04,451
Thank you.

724
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:06,244
For what?

725
00:39:07,192 --> 00:39:09,998
For... all of it.

726
00:39:10,789 --> 00:39:13,257
Every... Every bit of it.

727
00:39:13,835 --> 00:39:15,659
Except the bridge.

728
00:39:16,172 --> 00:39:17,828
Of all the things that
happened on this trip,

729
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,758
the bridge scared me the most.

730
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,137
Take care, Dummy.

731
00:39:26,055 --> 00:39:27,905
You take care, Anne.

732
00:39:51,196 --> 00:39:52,663
Yes. Y-Yes.

733
00:39:52,731 --> 00:39:54,898
Sam's Diner. Route 28.

734
00:39:54,967 --> 00:39:58,669
I should be able to ditch
the car and be there in an hour.

735
00:39:59,088 --> 00:40:00,548
And, Dembe...

736
00:40:01,073 --> 00:40:03,802
you definitely should have come with me.

737
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,878
Yeah. O-Okay.

738
00:40:11,216 --> 00:40:13,817
...by another ten days, uh...

739
00:40:13,886 --> 00:40:15,619
...is starting to...

740
00:40:15,688 --> 00:40:18,388
♪ For it was I who chose to start ♪

741
00:40:24,096 --> 00:40:28,599
♪ I see no reason to take me home ♪

742
00:40:30,102 --> 00:40:34,037
♪ I'm old enough to face the dawn ♪

743
00:40:57,262 --> 00:40:58,695
Ah, damn it.

744
00:41:26,158 --> 00:41:28,025
Anne. Annie.

745
00:41:41,573 --> 00:41:43,192
Elizabeth.
