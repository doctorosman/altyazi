1
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:06,690
Previously on "The Blacklist"...

2
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:08,258
Do you mind if I join you?

3
00:00:08,327 --> 00:00:10,727
- I'm Anne.
- Raymond.

4
00:00:10,796 --> 00:00:14,598
I don't know, Anne. I think your
life sounds rather balanced.

5
00:00:14,623 --> 00:00:16,130
I like to think it is.

6
00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:17,855
- What do you do?
- I'm a fugitive.

7
00:00:18,137 --> 00:00:20,046
Some people like to live dangerously.

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,369
What do you have in mind?

9
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,704
You. Helping me.

10
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,572
Finding a souvenir for my sister.

11
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:28,550
I know an extraordinary tiny, tiny,

12
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,945
"barely enough room for the both of us"

13
00:00:31,014 --> 00:00:32,413
chocolate shop.

14
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:34,808
What about "North by Northwest"?

15
00:00:34,877 --> 00:00:37,310
It's playing at
the Village East tomorrow,

16
00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:38,812
midnight screening.

17
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:42,449
You'll find me waiting for you
under the marquee.

18
00:00:42,518 --> 00:00:43,717
Raymond?

19
00:00:43,786 --> 00:00:45,685
Anne, I am so terribly sorry.

20
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:48,321
I'm afraid I'm not gonna
be able to make it tonight.

21
00:00:52,684 --> 00:00:54,217
Your position
in commodities is strong.

22
00:00:54,242 --> 00:00:55,542
Copper, gold.

23
00:00:55,697 --> 00:00:57,564
But the real returns
have been in crypto.

24
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,174
As you can see, year-to-date,
bitcoin has an 800% return.

25
00:01:01,303 --> 00:01:03,170
Your insistence on taking
a large position

26
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:04,821
was insanely prescient.

27
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,841
Must be nice, being so rich that
getting richer bores you.

28
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,544
I'm not bored.
I'm just... anxious to leave.

29
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,045
We have another appointment.

30
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,836
An appointment I'm a little
bit more concerned about

31
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:16,161
than the... state of my liquidity.

32
00:01:16,186 --> 00:01:17,752
We're running late.

33
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,486
What do you know about bridge?

34
00:01:19,555 --> 00:01:22,255
The game, not the way
to cross from here to there.

35
00:01:22,324 --> 00:01:24,891
Bridge? I don't... I-I'm sorry.

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,893
I was under the impression that
a comprehensive review of your

37
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:28,962
investments and holdings was of
the utmost importance

38
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:30,664
- at this time?
- It is.

39
00:01:30,732 --> 00:01:33,099
We anticipate a significant
increase in our need

40
00:01:33,168 --> 00:01:35,702
for available resources
over the next few months.

41
00:01:35,771 --> 00:01:37,204
Well, there you have it.

42
00:01:37,272 --> 00:01:40,207
We all have different interests
and priorities, don't we?

43
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:43,176
For instance, in the morning,
Mr. Zuma likes to start with

44
00:01:43,245 --> 00:01:45,345
the business section
then move on to the sports.

45
00:01:45,422 --> 00:01:48,056
I like to start with the funnies
and fall asleep in my chair.

46
00:01:48,116 --> 00:01:49,583
Takes me all day to read the paper.

47
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,951
- I like the funnies.
- No, I...

48
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:52,686
He likes the funnies, as well,
but he also has

49
00:01:52,754 --> 00:01:54,754
an amazing head for business.

50
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,957
Numbers and trends and,
you know, all the rest of it.

51
00:01:57,025 --> 00:01:59,392
Whereas I wouldn't know
a bitcoin from a subway token.

52
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:00,660
Well, you wouldn't have to.

53
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:02,963
Uh, bitcoins aren't a tangible thing.

54
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,067
They aren't? I wouldn't know.

55
00:02:07,135 --> 00:02:08,668
My investment in bitcoin

56
00:02:08,737 --> 00:02:10,670
was neither prescient nor insane.

57
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,373
I was just following
Mr. Nakamoto's instructions.

58
00:02:13,442 --> 00:02:15,008
Satoshi said buy, I bought.

59
00:02:15,077 --> 00:02:17,277
Satoshi Nakamoto? You know him?

60
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:19,045
Who... Who he really is?

61
00:02:19,114 --> 00:02:20,780
Yes, well, Dembe knows him
better than I.

62
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,148
They're like, you know...

63
00:02:22,217 --> 00:02:24,284
I-Is there anything else
we need to review?

64
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:25,785
We do have a plane to catch.

65
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,877
Uh, well, there's your holdings

66
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,424
in Singapore and the BSE, but...

67
00:02:31,449 --> 00:02:32,748
I-I'm sorry. You know Nakamoto?

68
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,128
The Nakamoto? No one knows Nakamoto.

69
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:36,997
Mr. Cane, we really must be going,

70
00:02:37,065 --> 00:02:38,865
which means you need to be going.

71
00:02:38,934 --> 00:02:41,167
Okay, well, if there's anything
else I can help you with...

72
00:02:41,236 --> 00:02:42,736
Not unless you know something about

73
00:02:42,804 --> 00:02:44,963
bidding or suit management.

74
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:47,107
Bridge.

75
00:02:47,175 --> 00:02:48,909
No.

76
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,147
Can I tell you
what I'm concerned about?

77
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:55,315
Townsend...

78
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,317
Oh, I am so confused.

79
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:00,687
The more I read, the less
I understand this game.

80
00:03:00,756 --> 00:03:03,523
...and that I'm not
going to be there with you.

81
00:03:06,295 --> 00:03:07,711
Raymond, I'm serious.

82
00:03:07,736 --> 00:03:09,636
I know, and I love that about you.

83
00:03:09,932 --> 00:03:12,073
But I'll be fine. I...

84
00:03:13,101 --> 00:03:13,992
I'll be fine.

85
00:03:14,216 --> 00:03:17,117
No patterns. You taught me that.

86
00:03:17,506 --> 00:03:19,039
You said it's the first rule

87
00:03:19,107 --> 00:03:21,942
of staying a step ahead of your enemies.

88
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,911
Do something once, it may go undetected.

89
00:03:24,936 --> 00:03:25,979
Maybe twice.

90
00:03:26,254 --> 00:03:28,682
After that, it's a pattern.

91
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:31,168
How many visits will this be?

92
00:03:31,193 --> 00:03:32,510
Five.

93
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,492
I like her.

94
00:03:40,226 --> 00:03:42,862
I like coming home to a port.

95
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,998
Seeing a candle burning in a window.

96
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:47,467
A smiling face waiting to greet me.

97
00:03:47,536 --> 00:03:50,637
I... I never liked it before.

98
00:03:50,662 --> 00:03:52,261
I like it now.

99
00:03:56,411 --> 00:04:00,680
Did you know that irises are
the state flower of Tennessee?

100
00:04:00,749 --> 00:04:02,716
What's the state flower of Kansas?

101
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,334
The sunflower.

102
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,754
She grew up with them. She likes irises.

103
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,143
I should be with you.

104
00:04:12,728 --> 00:04:15,095
You should be with Raymond Reddington.

105
00:04:16,365 --> 00:04:18,698
When I'm with Anne, that's not who I am.

106
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:21,267
It may not be who you want to be,

107
00:04:21,903 --> 00:04:24,229
but it's always who you are.

108
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,800
So much for the sexiest man alive.

109
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:33,252
- Down, girl.
- I'm just saying,

110
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,748
I like punctuality.

111
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,216
Maybe his plane was delayed.

112
00:04:36,284 --> 00:04:37,784
So, why hasn't he called yet?

113
00:04:37,853 --> 00:04:40,253
Only because I like to make
a dramatic entrance.

114
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,922
Raymond! Irises!

115
00:04:43,665 --> 00:04:45,792
- Oh, you're so sweet.
- Mm.

116
00:04:45,861 --> 00:04:47,327
Promise me you'll play nice.

117
00:04:47,396 --> 00:04:50,997
What are you talking about?
I'm a total softie.

118
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:54,000
I'll put these in water
and make you a sandwich.

119
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:55,568
You remember Bran and Lois.

120
00:04:55,637 --> 00:04:58,805
Yes, of course. Hello, Bran, Lois.

121
00:04:58,874 --> 00:05:00,073
- Hello, Ray!
- Hello!

122
00:05:00,142 --> 00:05:02,509
I hope you'll go easy on me tonight.

123
00:05:02,577 --> 00:05:03,943
You'll do fine. Gin and tonic?

124
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,546
Yes! We've gotten a head start.

125
00:05:06,615 --> 00:05:07,847
I'm sure I'll catch up.

126
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,883
I'm not so sure you will.

127
00:05:09,951 --> 00:05:13,053
Oh. Need a refill.

128
00:05:14,656 --> 00:05:16,072
Lois.

129
00:05:17,426 --> 00:05:18,958
So, flight delayed?

130
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:23,029
Yes. Seems to be the norm nowadays.

131
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,599
Anne is very trusting.

132
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:28,334
She thinks because
we live in a small town,

133
00:05:28,403 --> 00:05:30,437
she's got nothing to be afraid of.

134
00:05:30,505 --> 00:05:32,772
It's why she leaves her door unlocked.

135
00:05:32,841 --> 00:05:34,389
It wasn't unlocked just now.

136
00:05:34,463 --> 00:05:36,376
Really? Then how'd you get in?

137
00:05:36,445 --> 00:05:38,136
Anne gave me a key.

138
00:05:39,981 --> 00:05:41,481
Look.

139
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,483
I'm Annie's best friend.

140
00:05:43,508 --> 00:05:46,475
- Yes.
- I want her to be happy.

141
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,288
That makes two of us.

142
00:05:48,356 --> 00:05:51,891
Good, because if you mess
this up, I'm gonna kill you.

143
00:05:57,162 --> 00:06:05,170
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

144
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,274
Pass.

145
00:06:08,343 --> 00:06:10,443
Anyone for Go Fish?

146
00:06:10,512 --> 00:06:12,011
That's not a bid.

147
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:13,707
You're right. It's a cry for help.

148
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,849
- You can't make a bid?
- How about Crazy Eights?

149
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,517
No? Okay.

150
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:20,303
I bid... one heart?

151
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:21,988
One heart.

152
00:06:22,057 --> 00:06:23,516
- That'll do.
- Two diamonds.

153
00:06:23,596 --> 00:06:24,657
Two spades.

154
00:06:24,726 --> 00:06:27,193
- Pass.
- Pass, I think.

155
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,828
- Pass.
- Jack of hearts.

156
00:06:28,897 --> 00:06:30,930
Ah. And now it's my turn again?

157
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:32,632
No. Now you're the dummy.

158
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:35,401
- That's a bit harsh.
- Your hand is the dummy.

159
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,670
- Lay your cards down, face up.
- Thank you.

160
00:06:37,739 --> 00:06:39,572
I'm your partner. When you're the dummy,

161
00:06:39,641 --> 00:06:42,175
you say "good luck" back to me.
It's tradition.

162
00:06:42,244 --> 00:06:43,843
Well, good luck, good lookin'.

163
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,980
Now you can go get yourself
a piece of that cake

164
00:06:47,048 --> 00:06:48,481
before I eat it all.

165
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,683
Much to everyone's relief.

166
00:06:50,752 --> 00:06:52,051
Kick some ass.

167
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:55,388
So, Lois, what's it like
to be a police officer

168
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:56,783
in a small town?

169
00:06:56,844 --> 00:06:59,559
I ask because I'm something
of a true-crime buff.

170
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:00,960
You are? So am I!

171
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:03,429
I like the podcasts and
the documentaries on Netflix.

172
00:07:03,498 --> 00:07:07,100
Yes! I love those.
I loved "The Staircase."

173
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:08,701
- Oh.
- Queen of hearts from dummy.

174
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,436
And I love reading them, too.

175
00:07:10,505 --> 00:07:13,493
I first got hooked on "In Cold Blood,"

176
00:07:13,577 --> 00:07:15,074
then "Executioner's Song."

177
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,410
Ooh, I can take that. Ace of hearts.

178
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,313
- I haven't read that one, Ray.
- Oh, you should. Norman Mailer.

179
00:07:20,382 --> 00:07:22,248
Nothing like that goes on around here.

180
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,918
Thank goodness.
It's a pretty quiet town.

181
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,053
I've got a gun, but I've never used it.

182
00:07:27,122 --> 00:07:28,721
I can't imagine I ever would.

183
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,724
Mmm. Smart and sweet and funny...

184
00:07:31,793 --> 00:07:32,926
and she bakes.

185
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,928
I wish.

186
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,462
Cindi made that and brought it over

187
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:38,698
after we had that fender bender
in the parking lot.

188
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:40,967
That's how you say
you're sorry in a small town.

189
00:07:41,036 --> 00:07:43,703
Well, bless Cindi's heart.
And her frosting.

190
00:07:43,772 --> 00:07:45,738
- Six of clubs.
- King of clubs.

191
00:07:45,807 --> 00:07:47,006
Seven of clubs.

192
00:07:47,075 --> 00:07:48,274
Tell me how you two met again.

193
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,943
9 of clubs from the dummy.

194
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,945
Because it clearly wasn't
at a bridge tournament.

195
00:07:53,303 --> 00:07:54,747
We met in the park.

196
00:07:54,816 --> 00:07:57,450
Anne was watching birds.
I was watching Anne.

197
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,986
We bonded over a Cape May Warbler.

198
00:08:00,055 --> 00:08:03,056
Then he asked me to go see
"North by Northwest"

199
00:08:03,124 --> 00:08:04,531
and promptly stood me up.

200
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:07,360
But he's more than made up
for that since.

201
00:08:07,429 --> 00:08:11,331
We've been having an ongoing
classic-film festival.

202
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:13,366
We started with movies
with musical numbers.

203
00:08:13,435 --> 00:08:15,902
He's usually asleep
long before the end credits.

204
00:08:15,971 --> 00:08:17,270
Not tonight.

205
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:21,774
Tonight, we start on
Italian cinema from the 1960s.

206
00:08:21,843 --> 00:08:23,109
Oh, g...

207
00:08:23,178 --> 00:08:27,447
No one can sleep through
that zeitgeist of cool.

208
00:08:28,365 --> 00:08:29,949
Not even the dummy.

209
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,790
Ah.

210
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,944
I'm gonna have to re-solder
a wire on the output connector

211
00:08:58,013 --> 00:09:00,171
for this turntable to work.

212
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:03,069
I don't suppose you have
a soldering iron, do you?

213
00:09:03,131 --> 00:09:04,817
Uh, no.

214
00:09:06,844 --> 00:09:09,789
You know what? I think I'm gonna
run down to the hardware store

215
00:09:09,858 --> 00:09:12,025
and see if I can pick one up.

216
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,593
Take the truck.

217
00:09:13,662 --> 00:09:15,728
You don't want to waste gas
on your rental.

218
00:09:15,797 --> 00:09:17,030
You know where the keys are.

219
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,732
I'll have us dancing in no time.

220
00:09:20,108 --> 00:09:22,035
- Mm.
- Mm. Mm.

221
00:09:23,444 --> 00:09:24,771
What?

222
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:26,839
- Nothing.
- No, no, no. What, what?

223
00:09:26,908 --> 00:09:29,642
I'm a straight-as-an-arrow 52-year-old.

224
00:09:29,711 --> 00:09:31,511
I was married to one man,

225
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:34,647
my high-school sweetheart, for 25 years.

226
00:09:34,716 --> 00:09:38,835
I'm in a book club.
I go to church on Sundays.

227
00:09:39,387 --> 00:09:41,854
And somehow, I'm in
a relationship with someone

228
00:09:41,923 --> 00:09:44,757
who when he says the words
"output connector"...

229
00:09:46,094 --> 00:09:48,795
...all I can think about is sex.

230
00:09:48,863 --> 00:09:50,229
That's what I'm always thinking about

231
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,806
when I say "output connector."

232
00:10:04,702 --> 00:10:06,268
No patterns.

233
00:10:06,381 --> 00:10:08,348
You said it's the first rule of

234
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,683
staying a step ahead of your enemies.

235
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:31,493

But you're busy at work.

242
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,919
This is a particularly...

243
00:10:46,988 --> 00:10:48,921
fraught time.

244
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,656
"Fraught."

245
00:10:51,493 --> 00:10:54,694

That must be very hard. I'm sorry.

250
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,109
Is there anything I can do to help you?

251
00:11:10,426 --> 00:11:12,078
You're already doing it.

252
00:11:12,103 --> 00:11:14,403
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

253
00:11:14,516 --> 00:11:18,818
Out there, my life is so complicated.

254
00:11:19,268 --> 00:11:21,562
And here, it's not.

255
00:11:22,438 --> 00:11:23,956
I want to do more

256
00:11:24,025 --> 00:11:26,959
than help you set aside your burdens.

257
00:11:27,443 --> 00:11:29,487
I want to help you carry them.

258
00:11:29,964 --> 00:11:32,907
I can't do that unless
you tell me what they are.

259
00:11:34,469 --> 00:11:35,868
Anne.

260
00:11:35,937 --> 00:11:37,537
What?

261
00:11:39,707 --> 00:11:41,457

I'm just saying I wouldn't mind.

272
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:12,522
Because he likes true
crime? I like true crime.

273
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:15,658
All I'm saying is you know
next to nothing about him.

274
00:13:15,727 --> 00:13:18,261
I know... a lot.

275
00:13:19,731 --> 00:13:22,064
I know how he makes me feel.

276
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:24,867
I know he's got a business
and it's got problems.

277
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:27,537
And I know when he's here,
those problems go away.

278
00:13:27,605 --> 00:13:29,639
What business? What problems?

279
00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:32,608
I know, I know.
I'm the overprotective friend

280
00:13:32,677 --> 00:13:34,577
who should mind her own business.

281
00:13:34,646 --> 00:13:37,814
I'm just saying, I have never
met anyone from New York

282
00:13:37,882 --> 00:13:41,551
who wasn't either pushy, rude,
or a complete narcissist.

283
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:43,886
Well, first of all,
he's not from New York.

284
00:13:43,955 --> 00:13:47,089
And, Lois, to the world, I'm invisible,

285
00:13:47,158 --> 00:13:48,457
but not to him.

286
00:13:48,526 --> 00:13:51,060
He sees me, and I love him for it.

287
00:13:51,085 --> 00:13:53,352
I do. I love him.

288
00:13:57,426 --> 00:13:59,355
Does he know about the love part?

289
00:13:59,393 --> 00:14:00,627
No.

290
00:14:00,747 --> 00:14:02,557
He does now.

291
00:14:03,474 --> 00:14:05,374
Good morning, ladies.

292
00:14:05,443 --> 00:14:08,544
That coffee smells delicious.

293
00:14:08,613 --> 00:14:10,413
Good morning.

294
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,570
Hungry? I brought muffins.

295
00:14:14,623 --> 00:14:15,885
Thank you, Lois!

296
00:14:16,404 --> 00:14:20,122
But I prefer cereal,
the breakfast of narcissists.

297
00:14:20,191 --> 00:14:24,594
So we can gaze admiringly at
our reflection in the spoon.

298
00:14:24,619 --> 00:14:27,420
I better get on into the station.

299
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:31,033
Sorry.

300
00:14:34,105 --> 00:14:35,673
Goodbye, Lois.

301
00:14:42,614 --> 00:14:46,642
Have I told you about
the fork-tailed flycatcher?

302
00:14:47,651 --> 00:14:48,668
She's right.

303
00:14:48,841 --> 00:14:51,153
How they gather near
the elm trees south of town?

304
00:14:51,222 --> 00:14:53,522
You know almost nothing about me.

305
00:14:53,591 --> 00:14:55,491
I know everything I need to know...

306
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:58,527
Unless, of course,
those "business problems"

307
00:14:58,552 --> 00:15:01,352
are a euphemism for a wife
or a husband somewhere.

308
00:15:01,465 --> 00:15:03,232
No wife. No husband.

309
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,601
But there is a cat.

310
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:09,531
As well as other things
you should know about me.

311
00:15:10,074 --> 00:15:11,306
About who I am.

312
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:14,369
Raymond. I know who you are.

313
00:15:14,712 --> 00:15:18,280
You're someone who needs to see
the fork-tailed flycatcher.

314
00:15:18,349 --> 00:15:20,215
Which I intend to show you,

315
00:15:20,284 --> 00:15:23,631
just as soon as I find my binoculars.

316
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:24,987
I'm gonna go upstairs,

317
00:15:25,373 --> 00:15:27,923
and you're gonna make us
some sandwiches to take with.

318
00:15:27,992 --> 00:15:29,224
How's that sound?

319
00:15:29,293 --> 00:15:31,193
It sounds just right.

320
00:15:39,136 --> 00:15:41,537
I found two pairs and a blanket.

321
00:15:41,605 --> 00:15:43,772
I found salami and cheese.

322
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:46,942
I'll get a basket for the food,
and we're good to go.

323
00:15:47,006 --> 00:15:48,777
You told me the flycatcher

324
00:15:48,846 --> 00:15:53,282
can range as far south as lower Mexico,

325
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:57,920
and some have even been spotted
as far down as Argentina.

326
00:15:57,988 --> 00:15:59,354
What was that?

327
00:15:59,998 --> 00:16:01,523
Nothing. I was just...

328
00:16:07,298 --> 00:16:08,964
What were you saying?

329
00:16:09,341 --> 00:16:11,667
I was saying... I was remembering

330
00:16:11,735 --> 00:16:16,338
that you said you were thinking
about becoming a vegetarian.

331
00:16:16,407 --> 00:16:18,874
That pipe dream was about 12 pounds ago.

332
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,710
That's something my doctor
is always bugging me about.

333
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:23,779
Didn't you say there was an excellent

334
00:16:23,848 --> 00:16:25,914
vegan sandwich shop in town?

335
00:16:25,983 --> 00:16:28,684
- But you're already making lunch.
- Which we can bring,

336
00:16:28,752 --> 00:16:31,854
in case the tofurkey is inedible.

337
00:16:31,922 --> 00:16:35,591
Why don't you run into town,
order for both of us?

338
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:39,428
I'll finish up, pack, and be
ready to go when you get back.

339
00:16:39,496 --> 00:16:41,682
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

340
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,134
Okay. Two tofurkey sandwiches comin' up.

341
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,173
Oh. Hey, there.

342
00:17:25,242 --> 00:17:27,542
Hey. Here on a call. Won't be long.

343
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:30,545
A call? Really?
What seems to be the problem?

344
00:17:30,614 --> 00:17:32,614
County sent me.
Area's been having outages.

345
00:17:32,683 --> 00:17:34,983
I just gotta check your
ground wires. It's standard.

346
00:17:35,052 --> 00:17:36,752
Okay. Very good.

347
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,620
Vague, but detailed enough.

348
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:40,522
Delivered with authority.

349
00:17:40,891 --> 00:17:42,190
I'm not sure what you mean.

350
00:17:42,851 --> 00:17:44,561
You know what I mean.

351
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:48,030
Listen, mister, if it helps, I
got the work order right here.

352
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:51,066
Great.

353
00:17:51,135 --> 00:17:52,801
Ugh!

354
00:17:53,904 --> 00:17:56,371
How many are coming?

355
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,775
Everyone.

356
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,695
You found Arkham.

357
00:19:07,696 --> 00:19:09,448
In a chest freezer in the garage.

358
00:19:09,736 --> 00:19:10,964
His weapon's gone, vehicle's gone.

359
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:13,317
The girlfriend, Miss Foster.
Ping her cell.

360
00:19:13,342 --> 00:19:15,038
She left less than 20 minutes ago.

361
00:19:15,063 --> 00:19:16,810
Reddington wasn't far behind.

362
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,205
Wherever she's going,
that's where he's going.

363
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:23,280
Copy that. What do you want to
do about the missing vehicle?

364
00:19:30,986 --> 00:19:32,385
Reddington.

365
00:19:32,454 --> 00:19:34,321
This is between you and me.

366
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:36,156
It has nothing to do with her.

367
00:19:36,224 --> 00:19:38,024
You must be referring to Miss Foster.

368
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,393
She has no idea who I am.

369
00:19:40,462 --> 00:19:42,028
My family had no idea who you were.

370
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,644
They didn't know why they were
singled out or targeted,

371
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:46,802
but that didn't prevent their suffering.

372
00:19:46,871 --> 00:19:50,006
You still have time to rethink
this. It's not too late.

373
00:19:50,074 --> 00:19:52,008
It's interesting to me
how you speak as if you have

374
00:19:52,076 --> 00:19:54,477
any say in how this
will end for you, Raymond...

375
00:19:54,502 --> 00:19:56,668
as if it can somehow
be resolved in a civil manner.

376
00:19:56,693 --> 00:19:58,927
The one thing I can assure you of...

377
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:02,418
The one thing... is that
what is about to happen

378
00:20:02,487 --> 00:20:04,720
is going to be anything but civil.

379
00:20:06,658 --> 00:20:08,758
They got a track
on the woman's cell.

380
00:20:08,826 --> 00:20:10,041
She's close.

381
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,204
I have a second team
on their way to her now.

382
00:20:24,475 --> 00:20:26,008
- Anne.
- Hey. What are you doing here?

383
00:20:26,077 --> 00:20:28,211
If you needed something else,
you could've called me.

384
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:29,712
I need you to come with me.

385
00:20:29,781 --> 00:20:32,349
Is that blood on your hand?
What happened?

386
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,803
I'll explain in the car.

387
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:39,655
Raymond, are you okay? I-I don't...

388
00:20:39,724 --> 00:20:42,058
What's... What's going on?

389
00:20:44,896 --> 00:20:46,822
Stay with me.

390
00:20:51,035 --> 00:20:52,969
Raymond, please, where are we going?

391
00:20:53,037 --> 00:20:55,071
- Give me your phone.
- Raymond, what on earth is wrong?

392
00:20:55,139 --> 00:20:58,608
- Your phone, please.
- Raymond, you're scaring me.

393
00:20:58,676 --> 00:21:01,777
What's going on? And who's that woman?

394
00:21:09,422 --> 00:21:10,595
Here.

395
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,024
Hello. Can I help you?

396
00:21:17,695 --> 00:21:19,559
- You should leave.
- Is that a gun?!

397
00:21:19,584 --> 00:21:21,230
Raymond!

398
00:21:21,366 --> 00:21:22,832
Here. Come with me.

399
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,501
No! Answer my question!
What is going on?

400
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,003
I'm not who you think I am.

401
00:21:27,071 --> 00:21:29,639
I have another life, and
that life found us here today.

402
00:21:29,707 --> 00:21:31,974
We are in danger, and
I need to keep you safe...

403
00:21:32,043 --> 00:21:33,643
Someone wants to hurt you?

404
00:21:33,711 --> 00:21:35,412
They want to hurt us.

405
00:21:36,814 --> 00:21:39,268
Here. Stay here. Stay quiet.

406
00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:41,417
Only open the door if it's me.

407
00:21:41,442 --> 00:21:43,609
Anyone else, shoot. Do you understand?

408
00:21:43,721 --> 00:21:47,123
Just point and pull the trigger.

409
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:38,694
- Anne.
- Raymond.

410
00:22:38,764 --> 00:22:40,660
- W-What did you do?
- We have to go.

411
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:43,813
Who was that woman?

412
00:22:43,881 --> 00:22:46,916
- Please, just try and keep up.
- Where are you taking me?

413
00:22:46,984 --> 00:22:50,052
I don't want... stop! Let go of my hand!

414
00:22:50,121 --> 00:22:53,055
Anne, please. Listen to me.
There are people coming for us.

415
00:22:53,124 --> 00:22:56,125
It's not safe. You need to come with me.

416
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,916
Come with you where?

417
00:23:06,504 --> 00:23:08,443
Officers, may I have
your attention, please?

418
00:23:08,491 --> 00:23:10,573
- I'm sorry to interrupt.
- What are you two doing here?

419
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:11,995
May I please have your attention?

420
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,347
- My name is Raymond Reddington.
- Listen to what he has to say.

421
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:17,747
I'm a wanted fugitive. I have
two firearms on my person.

422
00:23:17,815 --> 00:23:20,149
- Gun!
- Someone will need to disarm me.

423
00:23:21,253 --> 00:23:22,952
Lois, we have a situation.

424
00:23:23,154 --> 00:23:25,730
I need you to listen to me
very carefully.

425
00:23:36,579 --> 00:23:38,702
Chief! Agent Barnes again on three.

426
00:23:38,727 --> 00:23:40,727
- Says they have confirmation.
- Agents en route?

427
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,294
In the air now. 40 minutes out.

428
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,862
Within 40 minutes, everyone in
this building could be dead.

429
00:23:44,931 --> 00:23:46,230
You really are him.

430
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:49,367
Lois, you need
to get her somewhere safe.

431
00:23:49,435 --> 00:23:51,329
Now. We don't have much time.

432
00:23:51,379 --> 00:23:53,384
You need to contact the highway patrol

433
00:23:53,434 --> 00:23:56,007
and sheriff's department
and any available units

434
00:23:56,075 --> 00:23:58,075
- from other counties.
- Can someone shut him up?

435
00:23:58,144 --> 00:24:00,980
Chief, I got someone from the
D.C. field office on line two.

436
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,247
They are coming here.

437
00:24:02,272 --> 00:24:04,105
Dangerous, highly trained mercenaries.

438
00:24:04,262 --> 00:24:07,463
He's not making it up.
I saw him kill a woman.

439
00:24:07,532 --> 00:24:08,864
Kill who?

440
00:24:08,889 --> 00:24:10,656
Lois, look at me.

441
00:24:10,681 --> 00:24:13,816
I am the most wanted man to
ever come through those doors...

442
00:24:13,971 --> 00:24:16,939
By a lot... And I came here by choice,

443
00:24:17,008 --> 00:24:19,575
not to surrender myself,
but to protect Anne

444
00:24:19,644 --> 00:24:22,611
from the very bad men who are coming.

445
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,613
You need to get her somewhere safe,

446
00:24:24,682 --> 00:24:26,816
because they will not be
intimidated by the fact

447
00:24:26,884 --> 00:24:29,485
that you're the police.
They will assault this building

448
00:24:29,554 --> 00:24:31,754
and kill everyone inside to get to me.

449
00:24:31,823 --> 00:24:35,024
Please, get on the mutual-aid
band and scramble any units

450
00:24:35,093 --> 00:24:38,694
within earshot, because this
is happening right now.

451
00:24:38,763 --> 00:24:41,530
It isn't just Wichita
coming for you, friend.

452
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:45,401
Kansas City suits are on
the way, a team out of D.C.

453
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,937
Chief, will you
take a look at this?

454
00:24:48,396 --> 00:24:50,940
Anne, talk to me. What do you
mean he killed someone?

455
00:24:51,008 --> 00:24:53,042
- Killed who?
- I don't know who she was.

456
00:24:53,111 --> 00:24:54,377
You saw him do it?

457
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:56,245
Neither one has plates.

458
00:24:56,314 --> 00:24:58,280
You may want to get away
from those doors, Chief.

459
00:24:58,349 --> 00:25:01,183
- What is happening?
- They're here, aren't they?

460
00:25:01,252 --> 00:25:02,852
Lois, I am begging you.

461
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,588
You've got to get your boss
to enact lockdown protocols.

462
00:25:05,656 --> 00:25:08,023
Get on the radio,
whatever cavalry you have,

463
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,934
call them in, now!

464
00:25:10,003 --> 00:25:12,261
She doesn't have
the authority to give that order,

465
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,563
and you sure as hell
aren't authorized to give it.

466
00:25:14,632 --> 00:25:16,232
You need to get ahead of this, Chief.

467
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:20,236
Sir, he's right. Whatever
this is, we are not equipped.

468
00:25:26,711 --> 00:25:28,244
Okay. Here's what we're gonna do.

469
00:25:28,312 --> 00:25:31,480
I want all nonessential
personnel out of the building.

470
00:25:31,505 --> 00:25:33,238
Beth, get the others
and go out the back.

471
00:25:33,351 --> 00:25:36,852
Pembry, find out what units
County has in the area

472
00:25:36,877 --> 00:25:38,844
- and where they are!
- Brandt, notify Butler

473
00:25:38,869 --> 00:25:42,867
and Lyon counties
and put local EMS on standby.

474
00:25:43,461 --> 00:25:45,328
Who are you?

475
00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:51,000
You need somewhere safe
where you can hide.

476
00:25:54,033 --> 00:25:55,404
That was Reeves.

477
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:57,396
There was an incident in town,

478
00:25:57,421 --> 00:25:59,288
but they have eyes on Reddington.

479
00:25:59,444 --> 00:26:00,643
What kind of incident?

480
00:26:00,711 --> 00:26:02,945
Landon. She's gone.

481
00:26:03,014 --> 00:26:04,847
- And Reddington?
- He took the woman

482
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:06,816
and went into the local police station.

483
00:26:06,884 --> 00:26:08,884
Ah. Raymond.

484
00:26:08,953 --> 00:26:10,566
You do keep things interesting.

485
00:26:10,618 --> 00:26:12,021
How you wanna handle this?

486
00:26:12,089 --> 00:26:15,124
Put Sagan on the police scanners
and have him give us a timeframe.

487
00:26:15,193 --> 00:26:18,561
If we're going to do this, it's
gonna have to happen fast...

488
00:26:18,629 --> 00:26:20,496
and happen now.

489
00:26:20,905 --> 00:26:22,531
I just spoke to County.

490
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,966
They're sending units now.

491
00:26:24,035 --> 00:26:25,935
Gonna take Anne to Emporia
and hold her there

492
00:26:26,003 --> 00:26:27,636
until we have a better handle on this.

493
00:26:28,121 --> 00:26:29,472
You can't wait for units.

494
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,906
You need to get her out of here now.

495
00:26:30,954 --> 00:26:32,508
Feds are 20 minutes out.

496
00:26:32,533 --> 00:26:33,999
How could you not tell me?

497
00:26:34,111 --> 00:26:36,912
I let you into my life, my home.

498
00:26:36,981 --> 00:26:39,882
I never wanted to draw you
into my life, Anne.

499
00:26:39,951 --> 00:26:42,184
I only wanted to escape into yours.

500
00:26:42,253 --> 00:26:43,886
How selfish...

501
00:26:43,955 --> 00:26:46,422
You getting involved with me
while knowing all of this

502
00:26:46,491 --> 00:26:47,756
was hanging over us.

503
00:26:47,825 --> 00:26:50,810
I let my feelings for you
cloud my judgment.

504
00:26:51,162 --> 00:26:52,728
I am so sorry.

505
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,275
When this is over...

506
00:26:57,735 --> 00:26:59,402
so are we.

507
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,507
Chief, take a look at this.

508
00:27:04,575 --> 00:27:07,676
That second SUV moved.
It repositioned around back.

509
00:27:07,745 --> 00:27:09,345
We have a third out front now.

510
00:27:27,698 --> 00:27:30,232
Cottonwood Falls Police. Chief Russell.

511
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:31,934
Chief! How wonderful.

512
00:27:32,003 --> 00:27:33,736
I presume you're the man in charge.

513
00:27:33,804 --> 00:27:35,204
I am. Who is this?

514
00:27:35,273 --> 00:27:37,540
I am the one who is here
for Mr. Reddington.

515
00:27:37,608 --> 00:27:40,442
I'm confident he's explained
the situation to you by now.

516
00:27:40,511 --> 00:27:42,878
You also know the closest units
are nine minutes out,

517
00:27:42,947 --> 00:27:45,848
which gives me eight minutes
to acquire my prisoner.

518
00:27:45,917 --> 00:27:47,816
Send him out now, you live.

519
00:27:47,885 --> 00:27:49,752
Surrender and walk away, you live.

520
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,186
Stay and protect him,

521
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:54,023
and we kill everyone
who stands in our path.

522
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:56,225
You have 60 seconds to send him out.

523
00:27:56,294 --> 00:27:59,562
Okay. Hold on. Let... Let's
start with who am I speaking to?

524
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:00,996
Fifty-five.

525
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,360
- Chief?
- Fifty.

526
00:28:07,471 --> 00:28:08,704
These guys are heavily armed.

527
00:28:08,773 --> 00:28:10,105
They're surrounding the facility.

528
00:28:10,174 --> 00:28:11,648
Hold on. L-Look. Anne, get down.

529
00:28:11,729 --> 00:28:15,077
Why don't I come outside and we
can talk, have a conversation?

530
00:28:15,146 --> 00:28:16,896
Forty-five.

531
00:28:19,684 --> 00:28:22,117
You still there? Can you hear me?

532
00:28:22,186 --> 00:28:23,986
Look. I don't care who you are.

533
00:28:24,055 --> 00:28:25,721
I'm not gonna bend to your demands,

534
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:28,057
and I'm certainly not gonna
send a man to his death,

535
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:30,025
even if he is a known criminal.

536
00:28:30,094 --> 00:28:32,595
What I will do is talk to you
until we come up with

537
00:28:32,663 --> 00:28:34,263
some reasonable compro...

538
00:28:34,332 --> 00:28:36,165
Chief!

539
00:28:41,201 --> 00:28:42,671
That was unfortunate.

540
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,607
But let's hope whoever
is second-in-command

541
00:28:44,675 --> 00:28:46,508
can be more reasonable.

542
00:28:46,577 --> 00:28:48,310
Send out Reddington.

543
00:28:49,095 --> 00:28:50,888
Now you're in charge.

544
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,865
Shots fired. Repeat. Shots fired.

545
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,943
We have active shooters
on site. Officer down.

546
00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:06,611
Requesting backup.

547
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,590
We got state troopers
east of Elmdale headed our way.

548
00:29:11,644 --> 00:29:13,310
County units are still
eight minutes out.

549
00:29:13,379 --> 00:29:15,037
If you have a weapons cache, open it.

550
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:17,914
We need to take positions
and push them back now.

551
00:29:17,915 --> 00:29:20,309
- I'm not giving you a weapon.
- Staying alive until

552
00:29:20,334 --> 00:29:22,801
backup arrives is
the only thing you can do.

553
00:29:22,826 --> 00:29:25,073
No. You know what I can do?

554
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:27,106
End this by giving them what they want.

555
00:29:27,174 --> 00:29:28,540
- What does that mean?
- Look. Stop!

556
00:29:28,609 --> 00:29:30,609
We're not sending him
out there to be massacred.

557
00:29:30,678 --> 00:29:32,244
- I am not protecting him!
- Hold on!

558
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:34,046
- Keep your heads down.
- She's right, Brandt.

559
00:29:34,115 --> 00:29:35,599
We can't send him out there.
They'll kill him.

560
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,933
- Just let me think this through.
- What is there to think about?!

561
00:29:38,002 --> 00:29:40,302
I am not dying for him.
The Chief already did that.

562
00:29:40,371 --> 00:29:42,605
- Brandt, stop!
- Do not go out that door.

563
00:29:42,673 --> 00:29:44,073
I'm coming out!

564
00:29:45,476 --> 00:29:46,897
I'm unarmed!

565
00:29:47,778 --> 00:29:49,545
You can see that, right?

566
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,693
No games.

567
00:29:52,216 --> 00:29:53,987
I just want to walk away.

568
00:29:54,782 --> 00:29:57,186
Oh!

569
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,309
That man has two children!

570
00:30:04,378 --> 00:30:07,172
I thought police understood
rules. I told you the rules.

571
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:08,507
You don't get to change your mind.

572
00:30:08,508 --> 00:30:10,802
I gave you 60 seconds
to send Reddington out.

573
00:30:10,938 --> 00:30:13,038
You ignored me, so now I'm coming in.

574
00:30:13,107 --> 00:30:16,508
The only thing that can stop
that is sending Reddington out.

575
00:30:21,793 --> 00:30:23,460
No?

576
00:30:23,751 --> 00:30:25,814
Okay. Be right there.

577
00:30:26,379 --> 00:30:27,611
You need to uncuff me.

578
00:30:27,636 --> 00:30:30,236
Lois, I can give them what they want.

579
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:31,694
You need to uncuff me.

580
00:30:31,975 --> 00:30:34,564
I'll uncuff you, but
you're not going out there.

581
00:30:34,648 --> 00:30:36,083
No. What are you doing? You can't!

582
00:30:36,108 --> 00:30:37,981
Annie, he's Raymond Reddington.

583
00:30:38,098 --> 00:30:41,533
If we're gonna survive this,
he's the only chance we've got.

584
00:30:41,558 --> 00:30:43,725
I'm removing these cuffs,
but so help me God,

585
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,518
if we get out of here alive,
I am arresting you.

586
00:30:46,543 --> 00:30:48,810
If you try to escape, I'll
shoot you. Do you understand?

587
00:30:48,902 --> 00:30:51,336
Given the circumstances,
that's not much of a threat.

588
00:30:51,361 --> 00:30:53,527
But, yes, I understand.

589
00:30:54,787 --> 00:30:56,720
Maybe we should give Anne a sidearm.

590
00:30:56,789 --> 00:30:59,223
- I don't want one.
- It could save your life.

591
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:00,758
Give it to her.

592
00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:03,227
This is for our defense only.

593
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:05,763
If this building is breached,
and only if it's breached,

594
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:07,798
you have my authorization to...

595
00:31:14,607 --> 00:31:17,074
Chase County Sheriff,
this is Officer Ethan Pembry.

596
00:31:17,143 --> 00:31:19,443
How far are those units?

597
00:31:21,314 --> 00:31:24,782
The detention cell!
Is it fully enclosed?

598
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,151
It is, but we can't access it!

599
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,453
- What? Why not?
- I don't have the keys.

600
00:31:29,522 --> 00:31:31,310
- Brandt does.
- Brandt?

601
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,126
- I can get them.
- No, no, no!

602
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:37,628
- We have to!
- It's too dangerous!

603
00:31:37,697 --> 00:31:39,430
No, Lois! No!

604
00:31:49,976 --> 00:31:51,675
No, no, no!

605
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:55,279
Aah!

606
00:31:59,986 --> 00:32:02,252
Get her to the holding cell.

607
00:32:24,696 --> 00:32:26,629
There we go.

608
00:32:37,223 --> 00:32:39,189
Keys. Where are the keys?

609
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:43,193
Here. Here.

610
00:32:47,366 --> 00:32:48,699
Okay.

611
00:33:09,388 --> 00:33:12,623
Well. Look what we have here.

612
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:13,857
Three ducks in a barrel.

613
00:33:13,926 --> 00:33:16,493
Anne. Keep your eyes on Lois.

614
00:33:17,736 --> 00:33:19,029
Get the door off.

615
00:33:23,402 --> 00:33:24,968
Just ignore him.

616
00:33:25,037 --> 00:33:29,239
Heh! This certainly is interesting.

617
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,777
Give me your scarf.

618
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:42,619
Mr. Reddington!

619
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:44,288
Take her hand.

620
00:33:46,236 --> 00:33:47,904
Hello?

621
00:33:56,288 --> 00:33:58,288
You should have left her
out of this, Neville.

622
00:33:59,148 --> 00:34:00,537
It's over.

623
00:34:00,606 --> 00:34:02,139
This was between us.

624
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:04,308
You're coming with me, Raymond.

625
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,777
We're ending this today. Here.

626
00:34:06,846 --> 00:34:10,380
Yes, I'd like to agree with you,
but then we'd both be wrong.

627
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:12,850
So, in turn, how about this...

628
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:16,453
Take your men and your guns...

629
00:34:16,478 --> 00:34:19,112
and your bloodshed... and go.

630
00:34:19,644 --> 00:34:21,692
Then come find me when you're ready,

631
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,161
and I'll show you the proper way
to exact revenge.

632
00:34:25,931 --> 00:34:29,399
Sir? We need to go. Right now.

633
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:38,121
The medics will be here any minute.

634
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:41,511
- Keep pressure on the wound.
- Mm-hmm.

635
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,982
I'm sorry, Anne. I wish I
belonged here with you, but I don't.

636
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:49,853
No. Stop.

637
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:52,756
I told you if we survived this,
I'd arrest you.

638
00:34:53,038 --> 00:34:54,838
You're under arrest.

639
00:35:24,139 --> 00:35:26,506
It's all right. You okay?

640
00:35:26,575 --> 00:35:28,642
Yeah.

641
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,743
FBI.

642
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,971
She needs a doctor.

643
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,340
Station's clear. We need paramedics.

644
00:35:36,409 --> 00:35:38,976
- Did you find Reddington?
- He was here?

645
00:35:39,045 --> 00:35:40,845
Clear!

646
00:35:41,614 --> 00:35:44,011
- I tried to stop him.
- You didn't find him?

647
00:35:44,036 --> 00:35:46,536
Not yet, but knowing he was
here, we'll drop a net so wide,

648
00:35:46,605 --> 00:35:48,588
even he won't be able to escape.

649
00:35:51,324 --> 00:35:53,688
- Who did this?
- My friend.

650
00:35:54,814 --> 00:35:56,413
I'm not sure where
you learned this, friend,

651
00:35:56,482 --> 00:35:58,541
but you saved her life.

652
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,284
Reddington was in town visiting you?

653
00:36:01,353 --> 00:36:03,053
I didn't know who he was.

654
00:36:03,448 --> 00:36:05,188
I'm told he came quite often.

655
00:36:05,257 --> 00:36:06,623
That's right. He did.

656
00:36:07,118 --> 00:36:08,959
But you didn't know who he was?

657
00:36:09,828 --> 00:36:12,129
You mean, was my life so boring
that I was willing

658
00:36:12,197 --> 00:36:15,132
to spice it up by dating
an international fugitive?

659
00:36:15,157 --> 00:36:16,790
No. It was not.

660
00:36:16,902 --> 00:36:19,236
But it turns out it was boring
enough for me to get suckered

661
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:22,639
by an international fugitive
into thinking he cared about me.

662
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:25,008
Now that I know the truth, believe me,

663
00:36:25,077 --> 00:36:26,843
if I can help you find him,

664
00:36:27,263 --> 00:36:28,779
well, that would be my pleasure.

665
00:36:28,847 --> 00:36:31,047
Glad to hear it, because
I have a lot of questions.

666
00:36:31,116 --> 00:36:33,583
And I'll answer every one,
but I need to go home first.

667
00:36:33,652 --> 00:36:35,385
One of my men will accompany you.

668
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,210
She's a victim, not a suspect.

669
00:36:37,565 --> 00:36:39,176
She's also my oldest friend.

670
00:36:39,219 --> 00:36:40,724
I don't want you hounding her.

671
00:36:40,793 --> 00:36:44,127
I just need to shower, change,
and have a good cry.

672
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:47,464
And then I'll answer
anything you want to ask.

673
00:36:48,242 --> 00:36:50,767
My car's in the lot.
Mind taking it home?

674
00:36:50,836 --> 00:36:52,736
Of course not. I'll be at the hospital

675
00:36:52,805 --> 00:36:55,205
just as soon as I've answered
their questions.

676
00:36:55,274 --> 00:36:56,873
I wish we'd caught him.

677
00:36:56,942 --> 00:36:59,643
But knowing he's out of your life,

678
00:36:59,711 --> 00:37:02,112
I do get some satisfaction in that.

679
00:37:06,185 --> 00:37:09,019
I told you if we survived
this, I'd arrest you.

680
00:37:09,087 --> 00:37:10,654
You're under arrest.

681
00:37:10,722 --> 00:37:13,623
Anne watched you kill someone.
I saw you kill three more.

682
00:37:13,692 --> 00:37:15,826
We're alive because of that.

683
00:37:15,894 --> 00:37:19,035
Not my chief. Not Pembry or Brandt.

684
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,564
They're dead because of you.

685
00:37:20,632 --> 00:37:23,366
I kept telling them
what they needed to do,

686
00:37:23,435 --> 00:37:25,035
and they didn't do it.

687
00:37:25,103 --> 00:37:27,771
You were right. About him.

688
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,540
The wolf in sheep's clothing.
But you were wrong, too.

689
00:37:30,609 --> 00:37:33,777
- Anne, don't.
- You don't understand.

690
00:37:33,846 --> 00:37:36,079
- You need to move!
- I can't.

691
00:37:36,499 --> 00:37:38,114
I won't.

692
00:38:01,974 --> 00:38:05,575
Lois said to take the Falls Road
east out of town.

693
00:38:05,644 --> 00:38:07,677
Most of the staties
don't even know it exists.

694
00:38:07,746 --> 00:38:10,213
Nobody will be watching.
She's a good friend.

695
00:38:10,616 --> 00:38:11,993
The best.

696
00:38:12,918 --> 00:38:14,839
The man who came after you today...

697
00:38:14,884 --> 00:38:16,520
Neville Townsend.

698
00:38:16,588 --> 00:38:18,788
He won't stop, will he?

699
00:38:20,492 --> 00:38:23,171
You were right. At the station.

700
00:38:23,629 --> 00:38:25,562
Us, getting involved.

701
00:38:25,631 --> 00:38:27,464
It was selfish of me.

702
00:38:27,533 --> 00:38:29,332
It put you in harm's way.

703
00:38:29,401 --> 00:38:30,767
It still puts you there.

704
00:38:30,836 --> 00:38:32,469
If I'm in trouble either way,

705
00:38:32,538 --> 00:38:33,937
why can't we be together?

706
00:38:34,006 --> 00:38:36,640
Because what I have to do
and how I have to do it,

707
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:38,508
you can't be a part of that.

708
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:40,500
No one should be a part of that.

709
00:38:48,153 --> 00:38:51,588
It won't be safe here until it's done.

710
00:38:51,657 --> 00:38:53,423
I understand.

711
00:38:53,492 --> 00:38:54,958
Is there somewhere you can go?

712
00:38:55,027 --> 00:38:57,694
And not to your daughter's.
They'll anticipate that.

713
00:38:57,763 --> 00:39:00,630
My friend Cindi,
the one who made the cake.

714
00:39:00,699 --> 00:39:02,132
She has a cabin.

715
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,534
Call her. See if you can go there.

716
00:39:04,603 --> 00:39:07,871
When it's safe,
you'll receive a postcard.

717
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,354
It'll be from the Corn Palace
in Mitchell, South Dakota.

718
00:39:10,436 --> 00:39:12,014
That's how you'll know it's me.

719
00:39:12,104 --> 00:39:14,711
But you don't know the address.

720
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:17,781
I have certain... capabilities.

721
00:39:18,309 --> 00:39:20,517
Too bad staying awake for
a movie isn't one of them.

722
00:39:22,955 --> 00:39:24,440
Ahh...

723
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:26,526
Thank you.

724
00:39:27,045 --> 00:39:28,319
For what?

725
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:32,073
For... all of it.

726
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:35,332
Every... Every bit of it.

727
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,734
Except the bridge.

728
00:39:38,247 --> 00:39:39,903
Of all the things that
happened on this trip,

729
00:39:39,972 --> 00:39:41,833
the bridge scared me the most.

730
00:39:44,309 --> 00:39:46,212
Take care, Dummy.

731
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:49,980
You take care, Anne.

732
00:40:13,271 --> 00:40:14,738
Yes. Y-Yes.

733
00:40:14,806 --> 00:40:16,973
Sam's Diner. Route 28.

734
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:20,744
I should be able to ditch
the car and be there in an hour.

735
00:40:21,163 --> 00:40:22,623
And, Dembe...

736
00:40:23,148 --> 00:40:25,877
you definitely should have come with me.

737
00:40:26,852 --> 00:40:29,953
Yeah. O-Okay.

738
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:35,892
...by another ten days,
uh...

739
00:40:35,961 --> 00:40:37,694
...is starting to...

740
00:40:37,763 --> 00:40:40,463
♪ For it was I who chose to start ♪

741
00:40:46,171 --> 00:40:50,674
♪ I see no reason to take me home ♪

742
00:40:52,184 --> 00:40:56,119
♪ I'm old enough to face the dawn ♪

743
00:41:19,337 --> 00:41:20,770
Ah, damn it.

744
00:41:48,233 --> 00:41:50,100
Anne. Annie.

745
00:42:03,648 --> 00:42:05,267
Elizabeth.
