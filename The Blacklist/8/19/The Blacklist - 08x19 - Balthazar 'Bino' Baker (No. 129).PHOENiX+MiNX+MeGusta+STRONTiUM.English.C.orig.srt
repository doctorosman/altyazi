1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,820
Previously on "The Blacklist"...

2
00:00:01,856 --> 00:00:04,189
I used to believe in salvation.

3
00:00:04,225 --> 00:00:07,526
Wait, wait, no.

4
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:10,248
That good was rewarded...

5
00:00:17,811 --> 00:00:19,711
...and evil punished.

6
00:00:22,482 --> 00:00:26,150
But I don't believe in that anymore.

7
00:00:26,186 --> 00:00:28,052
Not in this life.

8
00:00:28,088 --> 00:00:29,521
I've opened up a new directive,

9
00:00:29,556 --> 00:00:31,756
like the one for Rostova,
but double the bounty.

10
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,038
That won't be necessary.

11
00:00:33,062 --> 00:00:36,129
I'll be there. With Keen.

12
00:00:36,165 --> 00:00:37,731
Looking for me?

13
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:39,233
Drive!

14
00:00:39,268 --> 00:00:40,567
Liz, put the gun down.

15
00:00:40,603 --> 00:00:43,437
Not until I get the answer
I'm looking for!

16
00:00:45,274 --> 00:00:47,407
No! He knows where Townsend is!

17
00:00:47,443 --> 00:00:48,876
We have her in custody.

18
00:00:48,911 --> 00:00:50,310
Harold, bring her here.

19
00:00:50,346 --> 00:00:51,912
I'm the only one who can save her.

20
00:00:51,947 --> 00:00:53,113
Not today.

21
00:00:53,148 --> 00:00:55,382
Elizabeth Keen is a criminal.

22
00:00:55,417 --> 00:00:57,451
She will never be an agent again.

23
00:00:57,486 --> 00:00:59,319
She will never be a civilian.

24
00:00:59,355 --> 00:01:04,024
Her only hope for survival
exists in my world.

25
00:01:21,143 --> 00:01:23,176
Mr. Townsend is sleeping.

26
00:01:23,212 --> 00:01:25,279
- Keen is being moved.
- He can't be disturbed.

27
00:01:25,314 --> 00:01:27,214
I need to see him.
We have people in position...

28
00:01:27,249 --> 00:01:29,082
He was very clear.

29
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:30,918
Keen is in FBI custody.

30
00:01:30,953 --> 00:01:32,319
So?

31
00:01:32,354 --> 00:01:36,924
So hitting a federal convoy is public.

32
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,259
Messy. I need to see him.

33
00:01:39,295 --> 00:01:40,227
Hey.

34
00:01:40,262 --> 00:01:42,129
We work for a madman.

35
00:01:42,164 --> 00:01:43,463
I'm separating the man's medications,

36
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:44,932
so I know better than anyone else.

37
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:47,801
He's totally insane. This is insane.

38
00:01:47,836 --> 00:01:48,902
Watch your words.

39
00:01:48,938 --> 00:01:49,937
He's feeding off this.

40
00:01:49,972 --> 00:01:51,538
Destroying himself and us.

41
00:01:51,574 --> 00:01:52,773
The FBI raided us.

42
00:01:52,808 --> 00:01:55,208
- There are warrants for our arrest.
- You're out of line.

43
00:01:55,244 --> 00:01:56,543
I mean, what the hell
is this even about?

44
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,679
Elizabeth Keen has to die.

45
00:01:58,714 --> 00:02:01,081
We should go out, shoot feds,

46
00:02:01,116 --> 00:02:02,783
risk our own lives for some lunatic?

47
00:02:02,818 --> 00:02:04,184
What did you call him?

48
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:05,285
What did you call Mr. Townsend?!

49
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:06,954
I didn't mean... I didn't...

50
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:10,290
The man is avenging the death of
his wife and children,

51
00:02:10,326 --> 00:02:12,559
which means we are
the only family he has left.

52
00:02:12,595 --> 00:02:15,963
So we will take care of him
the way he takes care of us.

53
00:02:15,998 --> 00:02:18,966
Now let me do my work

54
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:23,503
and don't ever disparage
the good man again.

56
00:02:38,511 --> 00:02:39,676
Where are they?

57
00:02:39,712 --> 00:02:41,712
The decoy convoy is passing
through the Seventh Ward.

58
00:02:41,747 --> 00:02:43,080
Keen and Ressler?

59
00:02:43,115 --> 00:02:45,549
They held back.
Left just six minutes ago.

60
00:02:45,584 --> 00:02:50,087
Thank you. Best guess is
they are 23 minutes out.

61
00:02:50,122 --> 00:02:51,855
No interference?

62
00:02:51,891 --> 00:02:53,524
Uh, nothing yet.

63
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:56,793
Maybe Townsend isn't crazy
enough to hit an FBI convoy.

64
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,428
You really believe that?

65
00:02:58,464 --> 00:03:02,124
I do not. Just, uh, trying to
stay optimistic here.

66
00:03:04,837 --> 00:03:06,503
Why are you doing this?

67
00:03:07,671 --> 00:03:10,307
Ressler, you know what happens
if you take me in.

68
00:03:10,342 --> 00:03:12,217
I know what happens if I don't.

69
00:03:12,678 --> 00:03:13,844
Townsend won't stop.

70
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,579
And I won't bury you, Keen.

71
00:03:15,614 --> 00:03:18,081
I won't stand next to Agnes
while she cries at your funeral.

72
00:03:18,117 --> 00:03:20,517
You think I'm safer in custody?

73
00:03:20,553 --> 00:03:22,452
Townsend has people everywhere.

74
00:03:22,488 --> 00:03:23,921
He can hit me from the inside.

75
00:03:23,956 --> 00:03:25,556
I won't last more than a few days.

76
00:03:25,591 --> 00:03:26,773
We'll see.

77
00:03:29,361 --> 00:03:31,528
Even if you're right, what then?

78
00:03:31,564 --> 00:03:34,631
It's over. I'll never be an agent again.

79
00:03:35,324 --> 00:03:37,334
- I'm going to prison.
- You don't know that.

80
00:03:37,369 --> 00:03:39,670
If Reddington can still
walk around, you can walk too.

81
00:03:39,705 --> 00:03:42,122
The rules are different for Reddington.

82
00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:46,001
Look, what I've done, I can't undo.

83
00:03:47,044 --> 00:03:48,946
Mary Bremmer's death?

84
00:03:48,981 --> 00:03:50,948
The bomb in Reddington's hospital room?

85
00:03:50,983 --> 00:03:53,550
Everything that happened in Kansas.

86
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,763
You're holding on to a reality
that doesn't exist.

87
00:03:58,524 --> 00:04:01,141
Ressler, you have to accept it.

88
00:04:01,727 --> 00:04:04,595
Things are never going back
to the way they were.

89
00:04:05,187 --> 00:04:07,331
I tried to convey this, Harold.

90
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:12,102
But once again, we find
ourselves in a situation where,

91
00:04:12,137 --> 00:04:16,373
when faced with a unique, complicated,

92
00:04:16,408 --> 00:04:19,576
and volatile set of circumstances,

93
00:04:19,612 --> 00:04:23,146
you immediately punt
to bureaucratic protocol.

94
00:04:23,182 --> 00:04:25,282
Elizabeth's coming in.
I'm not releasing her,

95
00:04:25,317 --> 00:04:28,377
and you can be damn sure
I'm not turning her over to you.

96
00:04:28,854 --> 00:04:30,988
Things have changed.

97
00:04:31,023 --> 00:04:32,856
From the day I arrived,

98
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:36,293
my intent has been
to keep Elizabeth safe.

99
00:04:36,328 --> 00:04:38,495
To do that, I had to keep

100
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,765
certain facts about my life hidden.

101
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,500
Well, the truth is out.

102
00:04:43,535 --> 00:04:45,035
Whatever you're hiding, Townsend knows.

103
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,937
Yes, and because he knows,

104
00:04:46,972 --> 00:04:52,309
his focus has shifted away
from me and onto Elizabeth.

105
00:04:52,344 --> 00:04:53,694
Why?

106
00:04:54,778 --> 00:04:57,648
To try to make me understand
how he suffered

107
00:04:57,683 --> 00:04:59,716
the day his family was slaughtered.

108
00:04:59,752 --> 00:05:02,152
So he wants to kill Elizabeth
to make you suffer?

109
00:05:02,187 --> 00:05:03,820
Not just suffer.

110
00:05:03,856 --> 00:05:05,555
To understand.

111
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:10,360
He experienced something
too dark to comprehend.

112
00:05:10,396 --> 00:05:14,231
To avenge what was done
to his family and to him,

113
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,069
he wants to feel that I've experienced

114
00:05:19,104 --> 00:05:22,706
a similar darkness for myself.

115
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,413
Why are you telling me this now?

116
00:05:29,448 --> 00:05:31,515
Because you can't protect her, Harold.

117
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,152
And you're about to find out
what you're up against.

118
00:05:38,757 --> 00:05:40,057
Part of it's my fault.

119
00:05:40,092 --> 00:05:41,819
I didn't stop you
before you went too far.

120
00:05:41,843 --> 00:05:43,099
- Ressler.
- All the calls,

121
00:05:43,123 --> 00:05:45,262
going to meet you
without telling Cooper.

122
00:05:45,537 --> 00:05:47,831
That night you showed up
at my apartment.

123
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,701
You weren't wrong
for wanting to help me.

124
00:05:50,736 --> 00:05:53,470
But I didn't help, Liz.
I only made it worse.

125
00:05:53,505 --> 00:05:57,074
I mean, I let how much I care
about you cloud my judgment.

126
00:05:57,109 --> 00:05:58,809
This wasn't about your judgment.

127
00:05:58,844 --> 00:06:01,378
I knew exactly what I was doing.

128
00:06:02,648 --> 00:06:06,141
Look, if Reddington wants
to keep his secrets,

129
00:06:07,276 --> 00:06:08,418
it's fine.

130
00:06:08,454 --> 00:06:10,554
He can keep them all.

131
00:06:10,896 --> 00:06:13,790
Except for the ones that are
truth about my life

132
00:06:13,826 --> 00:06:16,093
and my daughter's life.

133
00:06:16,128 --> 00:06:17,928
Except for the ones that explain

134
00:06:17,963 --> 00:06:21,098
why psychotics like Townsend
wake up every morning

135
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:22,699
drooling about new and exciting ways

136
00:06:22,735 --> 00:06:26,953
to murder me and my daughter
as payback for something he did.

137
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,273
Those he doesn't get to hide.

138
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:31,508
And I'm telling you right now...

139
00:06:31,543 --> 00:06:33,443
I am so tired of the double standard.

140
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:35,912
- What double standard?
- You know.

141
00:06:35,948 --> 00:06:38,648
Reddington can do whatever he wants,

142
00:06:38,684 --> 00:06:42,319
and the Task Force
just takes it in stride.

143
00:06:42,354 --> 00:06:45,122
We don't even know who he is.

144
00:06:45,514 --> 00:06:47,424
Except for that he's a Russian spy

145
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:51,027
who murdered my adoptive father,
my mother,

146
00:06:51,063 --> 00:06:52,629
is responsible for the deaths of

147
00:06:52,664 --> 00:06:55,499
my husband, my half sister,
my grandfather.

148
00:06:55,534 --> 00:06:56,833
Nobody's okay with that.

149
00:06:56,869 --> 00:06:58,401
You accept it!

150
00:06:59,861 --> 00:07:01,772
Doesn't matter what he does. It's okay.

151
00:07:01,807 --> 00:07:06,576
But me? I fight back
and I've "gone too far."

152
00:07:15,721 --> 00:07:18,355
Looks like we just got some backup.

153
00:07:22,728 --> 00:07:24,828
Hey, uh, I'm monitoring your progress.

154
00:07:24,863 --> 00:07:26,004
Everything okay?

155
00:07:26,057 --> 00:07:27,697
So far, so good. No sign of Townsend,

156
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:29,866
and the backup you sent just got here.

157
00:07:29,902 --> 00:07:31,535
Backup?

158
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,904
Uh, okay, and, uh,
what backup would that be?

159
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:36,740
We got local. Two MPD units
just joined the convoy.

160
00:07:36,775 --> 00:07:38,975
Okay, negative.
I'm checking scanners now,

161
00:07:39,011 --> 00:07:42,312
but we specifically chose not
to ask for city reinforcement.

162
00:07:42,347 --> 00:07:44,322
Those aren't cops.

163
00:07:44,817 --> 00:07:46,616
Gun!

164
00:07:50,556 --> 00:07:52,389
Shots fired, shots fired! Officer down!

165
00:07:52,424 --> 00:07:54,057
Get us out of here!

166
00:08:46,912 --> 00:08:48,445
Where's Keen?

167
00:08:50,816 --> 00:08:52,249
Last chance.

168
00:08:52,682 --> 00:08:54,951
Right behind you.

169
00:08:56,722 --> 00:08:58,955
Hey, Ressler, are you okay?

170
00:08:58,991 --> 00:09:01,258
I can't hear what you're saying, honey.

171
00:09:01,293 --> 00:09:02,626
I can't breathe.

172
00:09:02,661 --> 00:09:05,495
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

173
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:06,796
Okay, we got to go.

174
00:09:06,832 --> 00:09:08,265
We cannot stay here. We got to go.

175
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,133
We got to move.

176
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:32,022
Tell me it's done.

177
00:09:32,057 --> 00:09:35,292
Almost. Two of our men are dead,
but the convoy's down.

178
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:36,493
She's on foot?

179
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:37,661
In the Seventh Ward.

180
00:09:37,696 --> 00:09:38,995
Less than a minute ahead of us.

181
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:40,897
I'm sending more men.
Lock the area down.

182
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:43,133
Clear every block until you find her.

183
00:09:43,168 --> 00:09:44,334
And then?

184
00:09:44,369 --> 00:09:46,069
If possible, bring her to me.

185
00:09:46,104 --> 00:09:47,737
If not,

186
00:09:47,773 --> 00:09:50,807
kill her and anyone else
who stands in your way.

187
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:03,933
Reports indicating shots fired.

188
00:10:03,996 --> 00:10:06,735
All units, officers down.
All units, officers down.

189
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,290
Witnesses on site report
multiple fatalities.

190
00:10:09,315 --> 00:10:10,915
EMS and SWAT en route.

191
00:10:12,885 --> 00:10:14,952
- Excuse me.
- Uh, convoy's down, sir.

192
00:10:14,987 --> 00:10:16,696
- Down?
- Attacked

193
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,864
by, uh, two gunmen
posing as Metro PD units.

194
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:20,789
So far they're saying three agents down,

195
00:10:20,824 --> 00:10:22,490
two in the support vehicle

196
00:10:22,526 --> 00:10:24,359
and the one driving Liz and Ressler.

197
00:10:24,394 --> 00:10:26,294
Aram, what about Elizabeth?

198
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:27,695
She's unaccounted for.

199
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:28,997
So is Agent Ressler.

200
00:10:29,032 --> 00:10:30,265
Although a witness claims she saw

201
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,066
a man and a woman
running from the scene.

202
00:10:32,102 --> 00:10:34,769
They're on foot? Where?
What exact location?

203
00:10:34,805 --> 00:10:38,273
The convoy was hit moving
southeast on Central at Wilmont.

204
00:10:38,308 --> 00:10:40,074
That won't be the end of it.

205
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,843
Townsend will have
more teams on the ground.

206
00:10:41,878 --> 00:10:43,111
Reddington, we'll handle it.

207
00:10:43,146 --> 00:10:44,612
The area will be swarming with police.

208
00:10:44,648 --> 00:10:45,980
We're running out of time, Harold.

209
00:10:46,016 --> 00:10:48,183
You look your way, I'll look mine.

210
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,156
I need your badge.

211
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,182
What about the gunmen?

212
00:11:21,218 --> 00:11:23,418
Both dead... found shot
at the crash site.

213
00:11:23,453 --> 00:11:25,053
I want you and Agent Park on site.

214
00:11:25,088 --> 00:11:26,888
Coordinate the Bureau and Metro response

215
00:11:26,923 --> 00:11:28,890
and find them before Townsend can.

216
00:11:34,264 --> 00:11:35,563
Take your coat off.

217
00:12:25,415 --> 00:12:27,315
I got you.

218
00:12:54,477 --> 00:12:55,777
Keen?

219
00:12:58,582 --> 00:13:00,181
We have to keep moving.

220
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:14,495
Raymond, even if we can avoid the police

221
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:18,499
and Townsend's men,
Elizabeth won't be easy to find.

222
00:13:18,535 --> 00:13:21,669
I agree, which is why
we're not looking for Elizabeth.

223
00:13:21,705 --> 00:13:23,805
- We need to find Bino.
- Bino?

224
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,308
I think his real name
is Balthazar something.

225
00:13:27,344 --> 00:13:28,776
Baker.

226
00:13:28,812 --> 00:13:32,680
Anyway, he came up as muscle
with Moms Wimbley,

227
00:13:32,716 --> 00:13:36,017
back when she went to war with
the Italians in the mid-'70s.

228
00:13:36,052 --> 00:13:38,152
- He was an enforcer?
- One of the best.

229
00:13:38,188 --> 00:13:41,022
Story was he had more hits
than Babe Ruth.

230
00:13:41,057 --> 00:13:43,558
People started calling him Bambino.

231
00:13:43,593 --> 00:13:45,693
After a while, just Bino.

232
00:13:45,729 --> 00:13:50,031
Nowadays, he runs a payday loan
operation in the Seventh Ward.

233
00:13:50,066 --> 00:13:53,267
His people move at least
half a million in cash

234
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:55,103
on those streets every week.

235
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:57,905
He's got eyes on every corner.

236
00:13:57,941 --> 00:14:00,475
Locals on the payroll who move his money

237
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,210
right under the law's nose.

238
00:14:02,245 --> 00:14:07,015
If Elizabeth and Donald are
still alive, he can find them.

239
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,050
He owns an underground chess club

240
00:14:09,085 --> 00:14:11,486
in the Seventh Ward... The Castle.

241
00:14:11,521 --> 00:14:13,721
Bino's a hell of a player.

242
00:14:13,757 --> 00:14:14,889
Way better than me.

243
00:14:14,924 --> 00:14:17,225
Maybe even better than you.

244
00:14:20,096 --> 00:14:21,896
You're still here?

245
00:14:21,931 --> 00:14:24,298
Rashad, go home.

246
00:14:24,334 --> 00:14:25,733
Take a shower.

247
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:27,435
Eat a sandwich.

248
00:14:29,172 --> 00:14:30,505
Ah!

249
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,873
The latest victim.

250
00:14:31,908 --> 00:14:34,342
Let me guess...

251
00:14:34,377 --> 00:14:36,177
The Greek Gift Sacrifice.

252
00:14:36,212 --> 00:14:38,012
First a shootout in the street.

253
00:14:38,048 --> 00:14:39,580
Now you show up?

254
00:14:39,616 --> 00:14:41,783
Hmm. Can't be a coincidence.

255
00:14:41,818 --> 00:14:44,018
I need your help.

256
00:14:44,325 --> 00:14:47,422
They're still in my Ward?
You're sure about that?

257
00:14:47,457 --> 00:14:48,756
I'm not.

258
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:50,258
I'm hoping.

259
00:14:50,915 --> 00:14:53,061
But you could make some
phone calls, Bino,

260
00:14:53,096 --> 00:14:55,229
let your network know
that these are our friends.

261
00:14:55,265 --> 00:14:58,166
Hmm. Friends who are
being hunted by shooters,

262
00:14:58,201 --> 00:15:00,334
not to mention the police and the feds.

263
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,136
These people are important to me.

264
00:15:02,172 --> 00:15:04,405
My people are important to me.

265
00:15:04,441 --> 00:15:06,541
If they get involved,
they could be killed or worse.

266
00:15:06,576 --> 00:15:08,876
They could be arrested and interrogated.

267
00:15:27,197 --> 00:15:28,496
Easy.

268
00:15:31,501 --> 00:15:32,567
Call Aram.

269
00:15:32,602 --> 00:15:35,597
No. It's not safe. You said it yourself.

270
00:15:35,633 --> 00:15:37,905
Townsend's got eyes and ears everywhere.

271
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:39,006
If we reach out, he'll know.

272
00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:40,523
We have to risk it.

273
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:42,543
No. No.

274
00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:44,145
Keen, you should go.

275
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,947
You won't make it out
carrying me around.

276
00:15:45,982 --> 00:15:47,582
I am not leaving you.

277
00:15:48,432 --> 00:15:50,685
You have to tell the police
where you are.

278
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,919
I don't care if I get arrested

279
00:15:51,955 --> 00:15:54,021
as long as you get to a hospital.

280
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:58,279
Where are we?

281
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,706
It's Ressler.

282
00:16:11,741 --> 00:16:12,707
We need help.

283
00:16:13,202 --> 00:16:14,909
I'm with Keen.

284
00:16:14,944 --> 00:16:16,511
We're on foot, but I've been shot.

285
00:16:16,546 --> 00:16:18,012
Townsend's men are closing in.

286
00:16:18,047 --> 00:16:20,046
Tell him we're at Danton and 56th.

287
00:16:21,422 --> 00:16:23,351
Hey, Aram, we're at Danton and 56th.

288
00:16:23,386 --> 00:16:25,720
Ressler is having a hard time breathing.

289
00:16:25,755 --> 00:16:27,922
I think the bullet might've
collapsed his lung.

290
00:16:27,957 --> 00:16:30,358
Danton and 56th.

291
00:16:30,393 --> 00:16:32,593
- Reddington?
- Elizabeth, listen to me.

292
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:34,996
I have a way for Donald
to get the help he needs

293
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:37,698
and to get both of you away from danger.

294
00:16:37,734 --> 00:16:39,200
Decision time, Bino.

295
00:16:39,235 --> 00:16:41,135
Help me and I'll help you.

296
00:16:41,171 --> 00:16:43,538
Don't just focus on the move
right in front of you.

297
00:16:43,573 --> 00:16:45,405
Look a few moves ahead.

298
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:48,543
There's a bar on Danton and 59th.

299
00:16:48,578 --> 00:16:49,544
The Outpost.

300
00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:52,914
If they can get there,
help will be waiting.

301
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:54,048
Did you hear that?

302
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,583
Yeah, I heard. Who was that?

303
00:16:55,618 --> 00:16:57,318
A friend. The Outpost.

304
00:16:57,353 --> 00:17:00,188
You're only three blocks away.
Get moving.

305
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:04,458
Why?

306
00:17:04,494 --> 00:17:06,093
Because, like it or not,

307
00:17:06,129 --> 00:17:08,896
he's the best chance
to get out of here alive.

308
00:17:08,932 --> 00:17:10,932
If you die, I'm gonna kill you.

309
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:12,133
You know that, right?

310
00:17:40,997 --> 00:17:42,964
There! One block east on Danton.

311
00:17:42,999 --> 00:17:44,165
Circle up to 58th.

312
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,022
Go, go, go! Cut them off!

313
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:04,819
Hello?

314
00:18:07,164 --> 00:18:08,956
Reddington?

315
00:18:23,873 --> 00:18:25,973
This way. Quickly.

316
00:18:27,443 --> 00:18:29,610
Quickly.

317
00:18:29,646 --> 00:18:31,078
Watch your heads.

318
00:18:41,057 --> 00:18:42,823
Find them!

319
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:46,861
Clear!

320
00:18:46,896 --> 00:18:48,162
It's all clear.

321
00:18:48,197 --> 00:18:49,430
They didn't go out the back.

322
00:18:49,465 --> 00:18:50,998
Door's bolted from the inside.

323
00:18:51,034 --> 00:18:53,167
They were here.

324
00:18:53,202 --> 00:18:55,403
Where the hell did they go?

325
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,949
This takes us under
the buildings going east.

326
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,274
You work for Reddington?

327
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,775
Honey, I don't know who that is.

328
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,510
You're in the pipeline courtesy
of Mr. Bino.

329
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:09,146
Whoever you are,
you got some powerful friends.

330
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,789
Metro's got a dozen officers
looking for them.

331
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,838
So far, no sign of either of them.

332
00:19:20,888 --> 00:19:23,427
I just checked with Dispatch.
No sightings came in to 911.

333
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:25,429
Maybe they aren't running.

334
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:26,797
Maybe they were taken.

335
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,966
Hey, we got a report of gunfire.

336
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,301
Patrol on canvass heard the shots.

337
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,336
- Where?
- About eight blocks north on Danton.

338
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:34,405
A bar called The Outpost.

339
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,543
They're here. Keep searching.

340
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:40,945
We are out of time.

341
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,947
Someone must've heard the shots.

342
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:44,199
Sir,

343
00:19:44,244 --> 00:19:46,450
if we don't go now, we're gonna have to
fight our way out.

344
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,755
Fine. Clear out.

345
00:19:57,532 --> 00:19:59,029
Take her to the safe house on Bowden.

346
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:00,498
I don't have her.

347
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,200
I thought we did, but

348
00:20:02,249 --> 00:20:03,834
I don't know. It's almost like
she disappeared.

349
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,202
Disappeared?

350
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:07,338
We have to clear this area.
Our location's blown.

351
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,840
Seems I made a mistake
entrusting this to you.

352
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,976
No, sir, I can find her.

353
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,778
Apparently not.

354
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:20,618
Here you go, darlings.

355
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,987
Far as I take you.

356
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,422
Hey, Walter.

357
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:25,423
Delores.

358
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,992
You want to tell me
what the hell's going on?

359
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:31,362
Don't know. Bino said snatch
them up, so I snatched them.

360
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,063
Alright, in you go, the both of you.

361
00:20:33,337 --> 00:20:34,636
This is how the pipeline works.

362
00:20:34,672 --> 00:20:36,438
Whatever's traveling
is called the baton.

363
00:20:36,473 --> 00:20:38,206
It gets handed from one runner
to the next.

364
00:20:38,242 --> 00:20:39,841
And we're the baton?

365
00:20:39,877 --> 00:20:42,310
Normally it's a brick of cash
half the size of Cleveland.

366
00:20:42,346 --> 00:20:44,880
But if Bino says it's you,
I guess it's you.

367
00:20:44,915 --> 00:20:47,215
He's hurt. We need to
get him to a hospital.

368
00:20:47,251 --> 00:20:48,717
Nobody said anything about a hospital.

369
00:20:48,752 --> 00:20:50,719
He's been shot!
He's having trouble breathing.

370
00:20:50,754 --> 00:20:52,754
Honey, we don't know where you're going.

371
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,589
Only the last runner
knows the destination.

372
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,058
Yeah, if you want a hospital,

373
00:20:56,093 --> 00:20:57,793
you're better off letting
the cops come and get you.

374
00:20:57,828 --> 00:20:59,194
That's not an option.

375
00:20:59,229 --> 00:21:00,462
Then I suggest you get in the vehicle.

376
00:21:00,497 --> 00:21:02,898
Time's ticking.
We got a hand-off to make.

377
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,303
A gunfight?

378
00:21:08,338 --> 00:21:10,605
Shots fired into and out of the bar.

379
00:21:10,641 --> 00:21:13,075
My guess is Liz and Ressler
were holed up inside.

380
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,643
Looks like Townsend's guys got in.

381
00:21:14,678 --> 00:21:16,344
Nobody's here, so we have to
assume they were taken.

382
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,379
Hang on.

383
00:21:17,414 --> 00:21:19,095
I've got another call.

384
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,783
It's Reddington.
Maybe he knows something.

385
00:21:23,654 --> 00:21:25,921
I'm concerned.
We tracked them to a local bar,

386
00:21:25,956 --> 00:21:27,823
but we can't be sure they made it out.

387
00:21:27,858 --> 00:21:29,091
Not to worry, Harold.

388
00:21:29,126 --> 00:21:30,926
Elizabeth and Donald are in safe hands.

389
00:21:30,961 --> 00:21:32,327
Thank God.

390
00:21:32,362 --> 00:21:33,628
How do you know that?

391
00:21:33,664 --> 00:21:35,263
Because I arranged the pickup.

392
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:37,933
An associate of mine
in the Seventh Ward.

393
00:21:37,968 --> 00:21:39,134
And he has them?

394
00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:40,535
I'm told they're in transit.

395
00:21:40,571 --> 00:21:42,404
Donald's hurt but holding on.

396
00:21:42,439 --> 00:21:44,840
They're not out of
the proverbial woods yet,

397
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,509
but we have reason to hope.

398
00:21:47,544 --> 00:21:49,111
Keen, if I don't make it...

399
00:21:49,146 --> 00:21:50,679
Stop.

400
00:21:50,714 --> 00:21:53,548
Almost everyone I love is gone.

401
00:21:53,584 --> 00:21:56,251
As it is, I'm barely hanging on.

402
00:21:56,286 --> 00:21:58,587
I cannot lose you too.

403
00:21:58,622 --> 00:22:00,640
Oh, so now you love me?

404
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:04,159
And you waited until we're in
the back of a hearse to tell me?

405
00:22:04,194 --> 00:22:05,961
Maybe you shouldn't speak.

406
00:22:05,996 --> 00:22:07,893
Save your strength.

407
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,900
It's okay, Liz.

408
00:22:11,935 --> 00:22:13,774
I know what you mean.

409
00:22:21,011 --> 00:22:22,611
I know how to do the math.

410
00:22:22,646 --> 00:22:24,980
I'm just saying they make
calculators for a reason.

411
00:22:26,162 --> 00:22:27,249
Whoa.

412
00:22:27,284 --> 00:22:29,217
Is he handing out money?

413
00:22:32,222 --> 00:22:33,688
Hey, Mister, can I get one of those?

414
00:22:33,724 --> 00:22:35,457
Depends. You want a job?

415
00:22:35,492 --> 00:22:36,525
What kind of job?

416
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,160
That money's a finder's fee.

417
00:22:38,195 --> 00:22:39,494
I'm looking for finders.

418
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:42,364
And if you're any good, there's
a lot more where that came from.

419
00:22:42,399 --> 00:22:43,698
Who you trying to find?

420
00:22:43,734 --> 00:22:45,700
Big crash over on Central.

421
00:22:45,736 --> 00:22:47,769
These two took off running.

422
00:22:47,805 --> 00:22:49,538
They're hiding somewhere in the Ward.

423
00:22:49,573 --> 00:22:51,006
You could find them yourself.

424
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:52,007
Maybe.

425
00:22:52,042 --> 00:22:53,308
But I know how it goes around here.

426
00:22:53,343 --> 00:22:55,343
People talk, but not to outsiders.

427
00:22:55,379 --> 00:22:56,745
If you want to find someone,

428
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,181
it's best to make arrangements
with the locals.

429
00:22:59,216 --> 00:23:00,949
No trouble, just information.

430
00:23:00,984 --> 00:23:03,985
If you know where they are,
call the number on the card.

431
00:23:04,021 --> 00:23:05,554
Anybody has a problem,

432
00:23:05,589 --> 00:23:08,857
tell them Mr. Townsend said it's okay.

433
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:27,042
Anton.

434
00:23:27,077 --> 00:23:29,044
What's up, little man?

435
00:23:41,825 --> 00:23:42,891
Bino.

436
00:23:42,926 --> 00:23:44,860
I'm hoping this is good news.

437
00:23:44,895 --> 00:23:45,760
Neville Townsend?

438
00:23:45,796 --> 00:23:47,929
That's who your people
are running from?!

439
00:23:47,965 --> 00:23:49,048
Does it matter?

440
00:23:49,072 --> 00:23:50,732
You're damn right it does
and you know it.

441
00:23:50,767 --> 00:23:53,101
If you had told me, I would've
never gotten involved.

442
00:23:53,136 --> 00:23:56,037
- Well, that explains my reluctance.
- I don't believe this.

443
00:23:56,073 --> 00:23:57,839
Do you know what
Neville Townsend will do to me

444
00:23:57,875 --> 00:24:00,375
when he discovers that
I'm the one who helped you?

445
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:01,561
Hard to say.

446
00:24:01,596 --> 00:24:03,345
Probably the same thing
I would've done to you

447
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,480
- if you hadn't helped me.
- This isn't a joke.

448
00:24:05,515 --> 00:24:06,781
I'm not laughing, Bino.

449
00:24:06,817 --> 00:24:08,516
Townsend doesn't know it was you,

450
00:24:08,552 --> 00:24:10,452
so all we have to do
is keep it that way.

451
00:24:10,487 --> 00:24:13,521
I'm out. You hear me? I'm out!

452
00:24:13,557 --> 00:24:15,223
It's too late. You're already in.

453
00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:16,391
They're in transit.

454
00:24:16,426 --> 00:24:18,593
Deal's off. I'm turning them over.

455
00:24:18,629 --> 00:24:20,962
- That would be a mistake.
- You should've told me.

456
00:24:20,998 --> 00:24:25,170
Bottom line... I'm more afraid
of him than I am of you.

457
00:24:25,195 --> 00:24:26,374
Don't do this.

458
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:29,153
If you give them to Townsend,
he'll kill them.

459
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:31,406
Better them than me.

460
00:24:50,315 --> 00:24:51,681
We're here.

461
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:54,131
Head in and take the staircase
on the right.

462
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,750
That'll lead to a basement storage room.

463
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,418
Someone will meet you,
take you from there.

464
00:24:57,453 --> 00:24:59,921
Give me a hand.
He needs help getting out.

465
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,522
Ressler.

466
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:02,957
He's unconscious.

467
00:25:02,992 --> 00:25:04,158
Can you hear me?!

468
00:25:04,194 --> 00:25:05,259
Open your eyes, Ressler!

469
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,661
He's still breathing.

470
00:25:06,696 --> 00:25:08,095
- The car keys!
- Whoa, hang on.

471
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,964
I do not care where you were
told to take us.

472
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:11,632
We are going to a hospital right now.

473
00:25:11,668 --> 00:25:13,245
Do you understand me?

474
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,470
FBI, Walter.

475
00:25:16,506 --> 00:25:18,272
He's a federal agent.

476
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,241
If he dies, your life is finished!

477
00:25:20,276 --> 00:25:21,309
Now give me the keys.

478
00:25:21,344 --> 00:25:22,877
C-Can't go to a hospital.

479
00:25:22,912 --> 00:25:24,779
He's dying!

480
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,747
The nearest hospital is 30 blocks away.

481
00:25:26,783 --> 00:25:28,249
Your man doesn't have that kind of time.

482
00:25:28,284 --> 00:25:29,584
- He won't make it.
- I have to try!

483
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:31,285
Okay, there's a place. It's close,

484
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,920
but it's not a hospital.
There's a doctor.

485
00:25:32,956 --> 00:25:34,722
Used to work as a surgeon
before coming to America.

486
00:25:34,757 --> 00:25:35,990
Bino keeps one on the payroll

487
00:25:36,025 --> 00:25:38,492
in case one of his people gets hurt.

488
00:25:39,462 --> 00:25:40,528
What happened to him?

489
00:25:40,563 --> 00:25:42,163
Are you the surgeon?

490
00:25:42,198 --> 00:25:43,364
This is where you operate?

491
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:44,599
Who's this?

492
00:25:44,634 --> 00:25:46,000
Trust me, you don't wanna know.

493
00:25:46,035 --> 00:25:47,301
Gunshot wound to the chest,

494
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,569
probably a collapsed lung.

495
00:25:48,605 --> 00:25:50,238
All you have to do is stabilize him

496
00:25:50,273 --> 00:25:51,472
until an ambulance gets here.

497
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:55,376
Get them out of here.

498
00:25:55,411 --> 00:25:56,410
Please.

499
00:25:56,446 --> 00:25:57,812
Save him.

500
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,016
- Give that back!
- They won't let you call.

501
00:26:02,051 --> 00:26:03,584
Whole point is this place doesn't exist.

502
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,987
- No cops, no ambulances.
- He can't stay here.

503
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:08,689
Careful now. You don't want to
insult these good people.

504
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,327
Harold, sad to say things have taken

505
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,895
a nasty turn for the worse.

506
00:26:14,931 --> 00:26:16,664
The associate I told you about

507
00:26:16,699 --> 00:26:18,733
has reconsidered our arrangement.

508
00:26:18,768 --> 00:26:21,035
What do you mean? I thought Keen
and Ressler were in transit.

509
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:25,206
I'm sure they are, but Bino has
changed the delivery address.

510
00:26:25,241 --> 00:26:28,743
He found out that Elizabeth's
being hunted by Townsend,

511
00:26:28,778 --> 00:26:30,945
and he intends to give Townsend
what he wants.

512
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,680
You never told him it was Townsend?

513
00:26:32,715 --> 00:26:34,949
Of course not. I was trying
to motivate the man.

514
00:26:34,984 --> 00:26:36,450
So now what?

515
00:26:36,486 --> 00:26:37,718
Now we rally, Harold.

516
00:26:37,754 --> 00:26:40,838
Now we shock Mr. Bino
and the rest of them

517
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,990
with our poise and ingenuity.

518
00:26:43,026 --> 00:26:44,191
And how do we do that?

519
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,526
I have no idea.

520
00:26:45,561 --> 00:26:47,328
Well, that's not entirely true.

521
00:26:47,363 --> 00:26:48,863
I have one place to start.

522
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:52,066
That, uh, bar you mentioned,
is it still a crime scene?

523
00:26:52,101 --> 00:26:54,702
No, Agents Mojtabai and Park
had it processed,

524
00:26:54,737 --> 00:26:56,404
but they cleared out a little while ago.

525
00:26:56,439 --> 00:26:58,039
Good. Stay by the phone.

526
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,106
If this works,

527
00:26:59,142 --> 00:27:02,176
you and the Task Force
will need to work quickly.

528
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:15,022
Who are you?

529
00:27:15,058 --> 00:27:16,691
I'm the man you answer.

530
00:27:16,726 --> 00:27:19,126
I'm the man you tell the truth.

531
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,229
Yeah, sure.

532
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:23,597
Let's start with your name.

533
00:27:23,633 --> 00:27:25,232
First is fine.

534
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:26,434
My name is Arthur.

535
00:27:26,469 --> 00:27:27,735
I clean up mostly,

536
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,303
mop the floors, take out the trash.

537
00:27:29,339 --> 00:27:30,404
Okay, Arthur.

538
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,906
Two very good friends of mine

539
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,108
were told to come in
by a man named Bino.

540
00:27:34,143 --> 00:27:35,509
You know the man I mean?

541
00:27:35,545 --> 00:27:37,745
- Everybody knows Mr. Bino.
- Yes.

542
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:40,581
Bino told them to come in so
they could enter the pipeline.

543
00:27:40,616 --> 00:27:43,284
Still with me, Arthur?
You know what I'm talking about?

544
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:44,919
The pipeline?

545
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,081
So you don't?

546
00:27:46,116 --> 00:27:48,422
Well, that's either true
or you're playing games.

547
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,724
I love games.

548
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:52,259
In fact, I'm playing one now,
with dominos.

549
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,494
First, I line them up,

550
00:27:53,529 --> 00:27:55,062
then I knock the first one over,

551
00:27:55,098 --> 00:27:58,799
and it leads to another
and then another and another

552
00:27:58,835 --> 00:28:01,135
until the trail takes me
where I'm trying to go.

553
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,670
I don't know anything.

554
00:28:02,705 --> 00:28:05,272
Well, I should think not.
You're just the first domino.

555
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:11,345
Problem is I can't reach the end
of the trail unless you fall.

556
00:28:11,381 --> 00:28:12,913
Leave him alone.

557
00:28:12,949 --> 00:28:14,448
Look at that, Arthur.

558
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,751
The second domino has revealed itself.

559
00:28:16,786 --> 00:28:18,953
I'm the one who helped your friends.

560
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:22,556
Sometimes the dominos fall
without even pushing them.

561
00:28:39,542 --> 00:28:40,741
He's stable for now.

562
00:28:40,777 --> 00:28:43,511
But his lung, it's badly damaged.

563
00:28:43,546 --> 00:28:45,446
I don't know if it can be saved.

564
00:28:45,481 --> 00:28:47,715
Thank you.

565
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,583
Can I see him?

566
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:51,152
He's not awake.

567
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,020
Please.

568
00:29:05,234 --> 00:29:06,687
Hey.

569
00:29:07,236 --> 00:29:08,436
I'm here.

570
00:29:13,235 --> 00:29:15,709
I've been thinking about what you said.

571
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,814
How everything I've done,

572
00:29:20,075 --> 00:29:24,518
the choices I've made
are partly your fault.

573
00:29:26,722 --> 00:29:28,750
You know that's crazy, right?

574
00:29:29,192 --> 00:29:35,062
Aside from being sort of chauvinistic.

575
00:29:40,837 --> 00:29:44,772
You know, Reddington, Tom.

576
00:29:45,971 --> 00:29:48,559
For whatever reason,
I live in a world where...

577
00:29:48,946 --> 00:29:51,545
people aren't who they seem to be.

578
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:57,112
It's hard to know

579
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:01,222
what or who to believe.

580
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:04,536
But you.

581
00:30:06,295 --> 00:30:08,290
You've always been there.

582
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,878
The real you,

583
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,172
telling me the truth.

584
00:30:19,175 --> 00:30:20,534
And I love you for that.

585
00:30:25,739 --> 00:30:27,249
There, I said it.

586
00:30:29,186 --> 00:30:30,786
It wasn't in the back of a hearse,

587
00:30:30,821 --> 00:30:35,557
but, hey, the back of a Chinese
restaurant is pretty good.

588
00:30:41,412 --> 00:30:42,866
You're okay.

589
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:47,496
We're gonna make it out of here.

590
00:30:48,071 --> 00:30:49,581
I promise.

591
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:54,294
Sorry, Ms. Keen.

592
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:59,447
But that's a promise you won't
be able to keep.

593
00:31:06,835 --> 00:31:09,645
It's like the sewer system,
only with cash.

594
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:10,769
I like that.

595
00:31:10,804 --> 00:31:12,370
The sewer system with cash.

596
00:31:12,406 --> 00:31:14,372
Bino's got spots all over the Ward.

597
00:31:14,408 --> 00:31:17,909
You come in, ask whoever runs
the spot for a loan,

598
00:31:17,944 --> 00:31:20,045
guaranteed against your paycheck,

599
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,813
which is coming
but you don't have it yet.

600
00:31:21,848 --> 00:31:23,415
And if you're approved?

601
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,916
We give you the cash.

602
00:31:24,951 --> 00:31:26,951
Or, if you're here to give back

603
00:31:26,987 --> 00:31:28,520
the loan that we already gave you,

604
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:31,389
we accept the money
and flush it to Bino.

605
00:31:31,425 --> 00:31:32,483
Through the pipeline.

606
00:31:32,511 --> 00:31:34,626
Bino's got pipes all through the Ward.

607
00:31:34,661 --> 00:31:36,261
This is just one of them.

608
00:31:36,296 --> 00:31:37,370
Bino called me,

609
00:31:37,406 --> 00:31:39,397
said he was sending two people over

610
00:31:39,433 --> 00:31:42,000
that I should snatch them up
and send them through.

611
00:31:42,035 --> 00:31:44,036
These pipes...
Where exactly do they lead?

612
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:46,371
Bino's not stupid. The runners only know

613
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:48,073
the next step in the journey.

614
00:31:48,108 --> 00:31:49,541
The next step then.

615
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:50,934
I need a name.

616
00:31:51,611 --> 00:31:52,844
Walter Stevens.

617
00:31:52,879 --> 00:31:54,112
You two found the right guy,

618
00:31:54,147 --> 00:31:56,262
but I don't know anybody named Delores.

619
00:31:56,286 --> 00:31:57,785
It's alright, Walter.

620
00:31:57,821 --> 00:31:59,254
We're associates of Bino's.

621
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:01,155
See now, I don't know
who that is either.

622
00:32:01,191 --> 00:32:02,724
You fellas sure you're in
the right neighborhood?

623
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:04,559
- Listen, friend.
- I'm not your friend.

624
00:32:04,594 --> 00:32:05,727
Hey, I don't... I don't know you.

625
00:32:05,762 --> 00:32:08,062
Now's not the time to be brave.

626
00:32:08,098 --> 00:32:10,064
It's the time to be smart.

627
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,101
Well, if you two and this
Mr. Bino were really tight,

628
00:32:13,136 --> 00:32:14,769
you'd go ask him what you want to know

629
00:32:14,804 --> 00:32:16,237
and you'd leave me the hell alone.

630
00:32:16,273 --> 00:32:17,505
I'm out of time, Walter.

631
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:20,208
Now, that's not your fault,
but I'm making it your problem,

632
00:32:20,243 --> 00:32:22,944
so did you see the two people
I'm looking for?

633
00:32:22,979 --> 00:32:25,113
A simple yes or no will suffice.

634
00:32:25,148 --> 00:32:26,581
Yeah.

635
00:32:26,616 --> 00:32:28,950
And you handed them off
to another runner, correct?

636
00:32:28,985 --> 00:32:31,452
Again, yes or no would be fine.

637
00:32:31,892 --> 00:32:33,560
No.

638
00:32:36,092 --> 00:32:37,659
Last chance.

639
00:32:37,694 --> 00:32:39,027
- Tell him.
- I am telling him.

640
00:32:39,062 --> 00:32:40,395
We never made the hand-off.

641
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,964
By the time we got there,
that agent was out cold.

642
00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:45,633
He'd been shot, wasn't breathing right.

643
00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:47,268
You didn't take him to a hospital.

644
00:32:47,304 --> 00:32:48,436
If you did, we'd know.

645
00:32:48,471 --> 00:32:50,077
It's not a hospital.

646
00:32:50,507 --> 00:32:52,407
Not a real one, anyway.

647
00:32:52,442 --> 00:32:55,777
I got Agents Mojtabai and Park
standing by in the Seventh Ward.

648
00:32:55,812 --> 00:32:57,278
Good, because I've got a location.

649
00:32:57,314 --> 00:33:00,281
Elizabeth and Donald were taken
to the Shanghai Palace,

650
00:33:00,317 --> 00:33:02,183
a restaurant at Weston and Grand.

651
00:33:02,218 --> 00:33:03,718
Dembe and I are headed there now.

652
00:33:03,753 --> 00:33:05,586
- A restaurant?
- I don't have good news, Harold.

653
00:33:05,622 --> 00:33:08,189
Apparently Donald had to be
taken to an underground surgeon

654
00:33:08,224 --> 00:33:10,258
because there wasn't enough
time to get him to a hospital.

655
00:33:10,293 --> 00:33:11,859
And you don't know his condition?

656
00:33:11,895 --> 00:33:13,962
- No.
- What about Elizabeth?

657
00:33:13,997 --> 00:33:15,496
I don't know. We're on our way.

658
00:33:15,532 --> 00:33:18,933
Call an ambulance and tell Aram
and Agent Park to hurry.

659
00:33:20,337 --> 00:33:24,305
So, you're what all the fuss is about.

660
00:33:24,694 --> 00:33:26,307
Elizabeth Keen.

661
00:33:26,343 --> 00:33:29,444
And you're Bino?

662
00:33:29,783 --> 00:33:31,312
I'm confused.

663
00:33:31,535 --> 00:33:33,548
Reddington said you were a friend.

664
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:35,249
Reddington has no friends.

665
00:33:35,664 --> 00:33:37,218
Your people are helping us.

666
00:33:37,253 --> 00:33:40,054
Only because Reddington
withheld the truth.

667
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:44,058
He never told me you were
running from Neville Townsend.

668
00:33:44,094 --> 00:33:45,893
Get her out of here.
Take her back to The Castle.

669
00:33:45,929 --> 00:33:48,096
Wait. Wait, Townsend doesn't
know you're helping me.

670
00:33:48,131 --> 00:33:49,664
You don't know that. He may.

671
00:33:49,699 --> 00:33:51,766
Which is why now my best option

672
00:33:51,801 --> 00:33:53,267
is to turn you over and apologize.

673
00:33:53,303 --> 00:33:55,703
No, no, no, wait, wait. Listen, okay?

674
00:33:55,739 --> 00:33:57,538
We're in the same boat, Bino.

675
00:33:57,574 --> 00:34:00,875
Your life is at risk because
Reddington withheld information.

676
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,710
Believe me, I understand that

677
00:34:02,746 --> 00:34:04,979
more than anybody on this planet.

678
00:34:05,015 --> 00:34:07,248
- Take her.
- Townsend doesn't even care about me.

679
00:34:07,283 --> 00:34:10,251
The only reason he wants me dead
is to get back at Reddington

680
00:34:10,286 --> 00:34:12,387
for something he did a long time ago.

681
00:34:12,605 --> 00:34:14,138
- What?
- I don't know.

682
00:34:14,173 --> 00:34:15,569
What I do know is

683
00:34:17,214 --> 00:34:19,343
if you want to make peace with Townsend,

684
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:22,919
you're not gonna do it
by turning me over to him.

685
00:34:23,837 --> 00:34:26,584
You're gonna do it
by killing Reddington.

686
00:34:27,446 --> 00:34:29,146
So let me guess.

687
00:34:29,288 --> 00:34:31,422
You'd like to help me do that?

688
00:34:31,457 --> 00:34:35,993
Bino, I can't think of
anything I'd like more.

689
00:34:38,898 --> 00:34:40,497
Put her in the car.

690
00:34:41,521 --> 00:34:43,601
No. No! No!

691
00:34:43,636 --> 00:34:45,108
Ressler!

692
00:34:45,638 --> 00:34:47,438
You.

693
00:34:47,473 --> 00:34:51,342
That man never wakes up. Hmm?

694
00:34:51,377 --> 00:34:54,578
Whatever you did,
undo it and get rid of him.

695
00:35:23,477 --> 00:35:25,877
FBI! Show me your hands! Hands!

696
00:35:25,912 --> 00:35:27,112
- No, stop!
- Hands!

697
00:35:27,147 --> 00:35:28,513
Stop! No!

698
00:35:28,548 --> 00:35:30,070
Put it down!

699
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:34,152
She's not here.

700
00:35:35,158 --> 00:35:37,055
Ressler, don't, uh... Don't try to move.

701
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:38,990
Help's on the way, okay?

702
00:35:39,026 --> 00:35:40,625
Castle.

703
00:35:40,661 --> 00:35:42,761
What's he saying?

704
00:35:42,796 --> 00:35:44,829
Keen, The Castle.

705
00:35:49,936 --> 00:35:51,569
Hey, here, over here!

706
00:35:51,605 --> 00:35:53,552
He's not breathing properly.

707
00:35:57,644 --> 00:35:58,877
Hello?

708
00:35:58,912 --> 00:36:00,192
Elizabeth. Is she there?

709
00:36:00,221 --> 00:36:01,379
No.

710
00:36:01,415 --> 00:36:03,415
Uh, but Agent Ressler is here.

711
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:05,984
Uh, he's injured, but EMTs are on site.

712
00:36:06,019 --> 00:36:08,653
- But no word on Elizabeth?
- No, we don't know where she is,

713
00:36:08,689 --> 00:36:12,457
but, uh, Ressler said
something about a castle?

714
00:36:12,492 --> 00:36:13,743
Does that mean anything to you?

715
00:36:13,779 --> 00:36:14,872
I can look into it.

716
00:36:14,908 --> 00:36:16,394
Tell Donald to stay in the light.

717
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,296
I'll call you when we know more.

718
00:36:18,346 --> 00:36:19,431
The Castle.

719
00:36:19,466 --> 00:36:21,871
Bino took Elizabeth back to his club.

720
00:36:22,736 --> 00:36:25,303
I understand. You did
the right thing by calling.

721
00:36:25,339 --> 00:36:27,405
I hope you'll accept my apology.

722
00:36:27,441 --> 00:36:29,607
Reddington intentionally misled me.

723
00:36:29,643 --> 00:36:31,676
Of course I'd never agree to intervene

724
00:36:31,712 --> 00:36:33,244
if I'd known you were involved.

725
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,813
And you have Keen?

726
00:36:34,848 --> 00:36:36,047
With me now.

727
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:37,615
I understand your people
are in the Ward?

728
00:36:37,651 --> 00:36:40,518
So am I. This is something that
I'm handling personally.

729
00:36:40,554 --> 00:36:43,221
Even better. I have a small club
where I do business.

730
00:36:43,256 --> 00:36:44,422
I'll send you the address.

731
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:46,358
Keen will be waiting when you arrive.

732
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,028
And, Mr. Townsend,

733
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:53,698
I really do appreciate
your understanding.

734
00:36:54,571 --> 00:36:57,936
This was all an unfortunate mistake.

735
00:36:59,721 --> 00:37:01,106
Hello?

736
00:37:11,969 --> 00:37:13,369
Castle. What does that mean?

737
00:37:13,404 --> 00:37:15,304
We don't know. A place?

738
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,106
Maybe some kind of safe house?

739
00:37:17,141 --> 00:37:19,242
Whatever it is, if that's
where Bino took Keen,

740
00:37:19,277 --> 00:37:21,377
we need to find it fast.

741
00:37:28,386 --> 00:37:32,154
He's gonna kill me for something
I had nothing to do with.

742
00:37:32,442 --> 00:37:34,361
That doesn't bother you?

743
00:37:35,693 --> 00:37:37,727
You sound surprised.

744
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:40,830
You own a chess club.

745
00:37:40,865 --> 00:37:42,952
You like the game.

746
00:37:44,202 --> 00:37:47,904
I'm the pawn, and you're serving
me up for the slaughter.

747
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:50,126
It's a gambit.

748
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:52,542
You know that term?

749
00:37:52,577 --> 00:37:56,145
It's when a player sacrifices a piece

750
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:00,116
in order to gain a positional
advantage later in the match.

751
00:38:00,151 --> 00:38:01,551
A calculated risk.

752
00:38:01,586 --> 00:38:04,687
And what advantage are you
hoping to get exactly?

753
00:38:04,722 --> 00:38:06,055
Are you kidding?

754
00:38:06,267 --> 00:38:09,325
We're talking about Neville Townsend,

755
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,160
the one man powerful enough

756
00:38:11,195 --> 00:38:14,931
to make Raymond Reddington think twice.

757
00:38:15,235 --> 00:38:16,566
Look around.

758
00:38:16,601 --> 00:38:19,235
I may be small time,
but that does not mean

759
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:21,871
that I don't have big-time aspirations.

760
00:38:21,906 --> 00:38:25,074
A man like Neville Townsend
snaps his fingers

761
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:27,143
and my life changes.

762
00:38:27,178 --> 00:38:29,378
Or it ends completely.

763
00:38:29,414 --> 00:38:33,382
Like I said, a calculated risk.

764
00:38:33,418 --> 00:38:37,153
And all things considered,
I like my chances.

765
00:38:37,188 --> 00:38:38,888
You don't know him.

766
00:38:38,923 --> 00:38:40,323
I do.

767
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:43,759
Apparently,
you're really important to him.

768
00:38:43,795 --> 00:38:47,463
So important that he came to
take care of you in person.

769
00:38:47,498 --> 00:38:49,599
It seems to me that
he'd be very grateful

770
00:38:49,634 --> 00:38:51,934
to a guy like me for making it easy.

771
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,302
That's not how he thinks.

772
00:38:55,173 --> 00:38:56,405
They must've gone around the back.

773
00:38:56,441 --> 00:38:58,708
I'm telling you,
he's gonna kill us both.

774
00:39:00,155 --> 00:39:01,877
We'll soon find out.

775
00:39:01,913 --> 00:39:02,979
Open it.

776
00:39:15,378 --> 00:39:17,259
I have to say,
I'm finding it hard to resist

777
00:39:17,295 --> 00:39:18,594
a chess pun in this moment.

778
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,062
But, I mean, if you can't
say "checkmate"

779
00:39:20,098 --> 00:39:22,732
- at a time like this...
- Checkmate.

780
00:39:24,168 --> 00:39:25,635
Drop your gun.

781
00:39:28,016 --> 00:39:30,539
Elizabeth, I'm certainly not
looking for a thank you,

782
00:39:30,575 --> 00:39:33,609
but this does seem uncalled for.

783
00:39:33,645 --> 00:39:34,939
Why?

784
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,442
Because you saved me?

785
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,949
From a man I didn't know,

786
00:39:39,984 --> 00:39:42,697
who only wanted to kill me
because of you?

787
00:39:43,087 --> 00:39:45,287
I can't take it anymore.

788
00:39:45,323 --> 00:39:46,993
You're not wrong.

789
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,792
I understand your anger.

790
00:39:49,827 --> 00:39:52,461
They're all dead because of you.

791
00:39:53,666 --> 00:39:55,210
Tom,

792
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:58,801
Esi, Jennifer, my mother.

793
00:39:58,836 --> 00:40:00,670
Elizabeth, please.

794
00:40:00,705 --> 00:40:02,805
We have to go. Put the gun down.

795
00:40:03,384 --> 00:40:05,441
Yes, they're all dead.

796
00:40:05,929 --> 00:40:09,111
I tried to tell you that
this is what would happen.

797
00:40:09,147 --> 00:40:10,546
Everything I've been afraid of,

798
00:40:10,581 --> 00:40:13,816
everything I came into your life
to prevent,

799
00:40:13,851 --> 00:40:15,484
it's happening.

800
00:40:15,939 --> 00:40:17,687
Secrets I've been keeping

801
00:40:17,722 --> 00:40:21,357
because to tell them would mean
dangerous people like Townsend

802
00:40:21,392 --> 00:40:25,394
would stop at nothing to
kill you and your daughter.

803
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:28,197
And now some of those secrets are out,

804
00:40:28,232 --> 00:40:30,119
and they are coming.

805
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,747
I'm sorry.

806
00:40:33,404 --> 00:40:37,106
I've tried so hard for so long

807
00:40:37,141 --> 00:40:41,010
to protect you from all of this.

808
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:43,612
And I've failed.

809
00:41:03,401 --> 00:41:04,900
Raymond, we're out of time.

810
00:41:04,936 --> 00:41:06,869
We have a car nearby.

811
00:41:06,904 --> 00:41:09,271
They're coming front and back.

812
00:41:09,307 --> 00:41:12,308
That doesn't sound good
under any circumstances.
