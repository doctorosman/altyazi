1
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,048
Yine mi?

2
00:00:36,044 --> 00:00:37,411
Yeah?

3
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,537
This is Zimmer Security.

4
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,115
We have an alarm alert.

5
00:00:40,139 --> 00:00:41,383
Yeah, everything's fine.

6
00:00:41,407 --> 00:00:43,769
Uh, raccoons tip the can.

7
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:45,739
They set off the alarm.
There's no need to...

8
00:00:45,763 --> 00:00:47,073
I have officers en route.

9
00:00:47,097 --> 00:00:48,589
They should arriving momentarily.

10
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,610
Well, listen, this is like
the third time this month.

11
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,901
Just tell the officers that they...

12
00:00:57,925 --> 00:01:00,270
Sir, we have officers on site now.

13
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:04,741
Police. Is anyone home?

14
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,278
Police. Answer the door.

15
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:09,579
I tried to tell you...

16
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:12,282
Interrupt a man while he's sleeping,

17
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:14,084
find out how a man sleeps.

18
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:26,529
I'm gonna make this easy, Carl.

19
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:29,432
Trip the alarm, your wife dies.

20
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:32,824
Look at our faces, your wife dies.

21
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:37,707
The key for box C112. Hand it over.

22
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,993
- You know who that belongs to?
- Stay down.

23
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:19,049
_

24
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:28,692
Once your wife calls, you're free to go.

25
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,105
Carl? They're gone. Are you...

26
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:44,374
Honey?

27
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,911
Hey. It's me.

28
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:49,579
Call Reddington.

29
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,603
Tell him we got a problem.

30

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

31
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:03,393
Carl, I entrusted you with my belongings

32
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:07,597
because I believed
that you could keep them safe.

33
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:11,634
Clearly I overestimated your abilities.

34
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,636
Yes. But with all due respect...

35
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,971
"With all due respect"?

36
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,640
What an absurd little qualifier.

37
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:20,910
Why do people insist
on stating their deference

38
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,879
right before undercutting it

39
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:26,016
with a mildly disrespectful provocation?

40
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,817
Whoever robbed you knew where to look,

41
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:30,300
and they didn't learn it from me.

42
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,260
So...

43
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:36,092
with all due respect, if there
was a failure of security,

44
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:37,927
it wasn't on my end.

45
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:50,967
_

46
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,665
Thank you, Carl.

47
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:56,980
Now, with all due respect,

48
00:03:57,004 --> 00:04:00,583
your cologne is beginning
to make my eyes water.

49
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,894
That was Marvin.

50
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:14,386
He's closing the other
deposit boxes as we speak.

51
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,166
Your hunch was right.

52
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,234
Elizabeth was behind the robbery.

53
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,438
Which means it had to be Hadley
who tipped her off to the box.

54
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:23,273
Carlos is holed up in Turin.

55
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:26,910
Yanka's nursing a gunshot wound
in Bariloche.

56
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,359
You think she hired the Confidence?

57
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:33,450
Yes, actually. I believe I do.

58
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,388
Harold.

59
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:40,690
It appears we can add bank robbery

60
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:43,259
to Elizabeth's burgeoning
criminal résumé.

61
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,028
What happened? Have you spoken with her?

62
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:46,343
Do you know where she is?

63
00:04:46,367 --> 00:04:48,198
I do not, but I know
a few of the criminals

64
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:50,066
she's been mixed up with.

65
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,103
They call themselves
the Fribourg Confidence.

66
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:57,507
In the past three years,
they've stolen over $25 million

67
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,709
from at least six U.S. banks.

68
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:02,045
Six robberies?
Why haven't I heard about them?

69
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,880
The thefts were never reported.

70
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:07,283
The Confidence targets accounts
held by criminals

71
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,852
who have arrangements

72
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:12,222
with somewhat unscrupulous
bank managers.

73
00:05:12,246 --> 00:05:13,923
I've never concerned myself

74
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:16,459
with the Fribourgians
or Fribourgers or...

75
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,728
I don't know. They never bothered me,

76
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:20,396
so I never bothered with them.

77
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,798
Until now.

78
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,434
Last night, they stole
something very important to me.

79
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,535
I want it back.

80
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,870
You mean Elizabeth stole from you,

81
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:28,538
and you're not going to tell me what.

82
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,306
What she stole is my concern,

83
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,176
but finding Elizabeth concerns us both.

84
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,246
This case may help us to do that.

85
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,082
$4 million stolen
from a Los Angeles bank.

86
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:42,285
A Monet taken from
a safe deposit box in Oslo.

87
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:44,721
Millions in forged cigarette tax stamps

88
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:46,289
vanish from a vault in Kobe.

89
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:49,125
According to Reddington, the
same heist crew which robbed him

90
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,327
have targeted banks
from Seattle to Ankara,

91
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,263
and none of the thefts
have been reported

92
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:54,898
because the targets were criminals.

93
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:56,966
And Reddington's sure it was
Agent Keen who hired them?

94
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,135
He wouldn't say what Agent Keen
was after or why,

95
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:02,305
but whatever it was,
he believes finding this crew

96
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,240
is our best chance of finding her.

97
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:06,242
And what happens when we find her?

98
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,011
We bring her in and just, you know,

99
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,546
pretend like none of this ever happened?

100
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,415
Something tells me that's not
what Agent Keen has in mind.

101
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,417
What exactly are you suggesting?

102
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,119
I don't know. It seems kind of crazy
to me that, um,

103
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:18,454
we're still calling her Agent Keen.

104
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,391
Agent Ressler, Agent Park,
see if you can find any leads

105
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:23,693
on this heist crew
from the bank manager.

106
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,128
We'll save the ethical deliberations

107
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:27,385
till after we've found Elizabeth.

108
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:33,169
This is crazy. If there was
a breach, we'd call the police.

109
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:35,605
But there was no breach.

110
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:36,940
And the security feeds?

111
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:38,608
A brief system glitch.

112
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:41,878
Which I was notified of, which
is why I came down personally

113
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,214
to check things out
and reset the system.

114
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:47,080
I need to see what's inside box C112.

115
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,485
- Excuse me?
- Box C112.

116
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,142
I need you to open it.

117
00:06:51,596 --> 00:06:53,423
Of course. Uh, Liam,
while I show them the box,

118
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:54,958
could you please go to the server room

119
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:56,159
and see if you can
put last night's feeds

120
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:58,228
on a drive for the agents?

121
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,802
We know the box belongs
to Raymond Reddington.

122
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:07,804
Actually, it's registered
to a Mr. Lloyd Wilke...

123
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:09,239
It's how we know it was hit.

124
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,441
We had people sitting on it,
waiting for him to show.

125
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:12,942
Mr. Wilke.

126
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,644
Play it cute,
we charge you with conspiracy

127
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,646
and you get a decade, maybe more.

128
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,359
Drop the Mr. Wilke BS,

129
00:07:18,383 --> 00:07:20,772
and you might be home
in time for dinner.

130
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,955
One of them, the leader,
I think, she pulled the lock.

131
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,357
The other wiped the security system.

132
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:30,660
The whole thing was over
in 5, 10 minutes.

133
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:31,861
I didn't see their faces.

134
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,930
- So the leader was a woman?
- Yes.

135
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,199
She went right for the box.

136
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:38,134
There's hundreds of boxes in here.

137
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:41,059
- If she knew where to go...
- She'd been here before.

138
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:46,142
Cynthia, to what do I owe the pleasure?

139
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,677
Shelve the pleasantries, Harold.

140
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:50,476
I'm hotter than a Laredo parking lot.

141
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:55,151
Alban Veseli has filed a motion
to withdraw his guilty plea.

142
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:57,053
I don't know that name.
Of course you do.

143
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,888
He's a contract killer
and the first criminal

144
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:01,237
you and this task force put in prison.

145
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,426
You're talking about The Freelancer.

146
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,894
Hid his murders within the headlines

147
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,696
of ordinary accidents and disasters.

148
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,232
If you're here, he must be making
an argument that concerns you.

149
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:11,267
His argument hasn't changed.

150
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,202
Our case was based
on information given to us

151
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,204
by a confidential informant.

152
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,706
Veseli says the trial judge erred

153
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,442
by not forcing us to disclose
the informant's identity.

154
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:20,996
So we violated his 6th Amendment

155
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,245
right to confront his accuser.

156
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:23,680
Sounds pretty standard.

157
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,181
Not this time.

158
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,350
He's hired Scooter Rovenpor
to handle the appeal.

159
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,419
Rovenpor could get
the devil off on appeal.

160
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:32,355
Old Scoot certainly got
the judge's attention.

161
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,290
We fought it, but he's ordered
both parties to appear

162
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,592
for oral argument
on the motion to withdraw.

163
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:37,727
Who the hell are you?

164
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:39,262
Agent Keen swore out the affidavits

165
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:40,730
based on the informant's knowledge,

166
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:43,154
so he wants to hear from Keen directly.

167
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,135
I'm afraid that may be difficult.

168
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,537
Agent Keen's in the field.

169
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:49,072
Then get her back.

170
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:52,041
She's due in Judge Velchek's
court first thing tomorrow.

171
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:53,743
We need to neutralize this, Harold.

172
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:56,179
If the evidence we got from
Reddington gets excluded,

173
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:59,182
our case is gonna be shakier
than cafeteria Jell-O.

174
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,184
A thousand dollars an hour?

175
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,618
A fee I've agreed to waive.

176
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,053
Why?

177
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:07,757
Not saying I don't
appreciate it, but why me?

178
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,881
I don't think you got a fair trial.

179
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,950
You believe I'm innocent.

180
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:16,099
No.

181
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:19,899
But I believe even mass
murderers deserve equal justice.

182
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:25,407
You think if I get it, I'll walk?

183
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:26,509
Maybe.

184
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:29,701
But that's all gonna depend
on Agent Elizabeth Keen.

185
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:05,547
Is anything more boring
than bird watching?

186
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:09,318
Six hours to maybe glimpse
the bill of a toucan

187
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:12,111
you can see on a box of Froot Loops.

188
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:15,424
Bird watching is more
than just birds, Cvetko.

189
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,884
It's seeing ourselves in connection

190
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,157
with the world in which we live.

191
00:10:20,181 --> 00:10:22,690
I live in laboratory.

192
00:10:22,714 --> 00:10:25,559
The only birds I connect with are dead.

193
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,495
Your world is uniquely inanimate.

194
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:30,130
Which is why I asked you here.

195
00:10:30,154 --> 00:10:32,548
I need to know who wrote this.

196
00:10:33,825 --> 00:10:35,236
It's not Elizabeth Keen?

197
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,512
Someone in her employ.

198
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,748
Who may have left a fingerprint,

199
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,883
a clue that could lead you
to her identity.

200
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:45,120
In the world I'm living in,
nothing is more important.

201
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,622
I'll see what can I do.

202
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:52,427
Under the greenwood tree,
who loves to lie with me,

203
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:57,614
and turn his merry note
unto the sweet bird's throat.

204
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,058
Nice rhyme.

205
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,816
Shakespeare thought so.

206
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:04,532
Okay.

207
00:11:16,034 --> 00:11:18,012
You said the robber
had staked out the bank,

208
00:11:18,036 --> 00:11:21,115
so I pulled a list of people
with safety deposit boxes.

209
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,349
Thought I'd catch Park up to speed

210
00:11:22,373 --> 00:11:23,751
on The Freelancer's handiwork.

211
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,286
Collapsed buildings, overturned ferries,

212
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,387
all to kill one person?

213
00:11:26,411 --> 00:11:27,855
Yeah, he was a real peach,

214
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:30,373
who may walk free unless
Liz shows up in court.

215
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,009
We have to find her.

216
00:11:32,033 --> 00:11:34,979
The only way to do that is
to find the thief on this list.

217
00:11:35,003 --> 00:11:36,280
Well, we better hope that Cooper

218
00:11:36,304 --> 00:11:38,582
can stall the judge until we do.

219
00:11:38,606 --> 00:11:40,084
To be clear, Mr. Rovenpor,

220
00:11:40,108 --> 00:11:42,586
your client pleaded guilty
to one count of murder,

221
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:46,524
namely the murder of a woman
named Floriana Campo.

222
00:11:46,548 --> 00:11:48,726
A notorious human trafficker,
Your Honor.

223
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,261
At the time, Mr. Veseli's attorney

224
00:11:50,285 --> 00:11:52,812
moved that the government
be ordered to disclose

225
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,082
the identity of
the confidential informant

226
00:11:55,106 --> 00:11:56,783
who supplied most of the information

227
00:11:56,807 --> 00:11:57,918
that led to his arrest.

228
00:11:57,942 --> 00:12:00,120
- A motion I denied.
- Yes, Your Honor,

229
00:12:00,144 --> 00:12:02,255
and in light of your ruling,
and only because of it,

230
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:05,058
my client felt that it was in
his best interest to enter a plea.

231
00:12:05,082 --> 00:12:07,694
Many cases are founded on intel supplied

232
00:12:07,718 --> 00:12:09,763
by confidential sources, Your Honor.

233
00:12:09,787 --> 00:12:11,465
You weighed the variables at the time

234
00:12:11,489 --> 00:12:13,467
and made a perfectly reasonable ruling.

235
00:12:13,491 --> 00:12:15,418
- I agree.
- You agree?

236
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,655
It was reasonable
based on the information...

237
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:20,124
you made available at the time,

238
00:12:20,148 --> 00:12:22,226
but since that time, new
information has come to light.

239
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,895
For starters, we now know
that Agent Elizabeth Keen

240
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,630
has made a number of high-profile cases

241
00:12:26,654 --> 00:12:28,632
based on intel
from confidential sources.

242
00:12:28,656 --> 00:12:30,100
A shocking number.

243
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,203
More, in fact, than any
other major case agent.

244
00:12:33,227 --> 00:12:35,188
We'd have to review those numbers.

245
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,859
The vast majority, if not all,
of those cases

246
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:40,928
were based on intel
supplied by the same individual.

247
00:12:40,952 --> 00:12:42,664
You believe that based on what?

248
00:12:42,688 --> 00:12:44,599
I've read the defendant's papers.

249
00:12:44,623 --> 00:12:47,235
All these cases... Ms. Navarro,
can you assure me

250
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:48,770
there were multiple sources?

251
00:12:48,794 --> 00:12:50,204
We are not able to answer that.

252
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,572
Because if she did,

253
00:12:51,596 --> 00:12:53,141
you'd wonder if there was
any informant at all,

254
00:12:53,165 --> 00:12:55,677
since one person couldn't possibly have

255
00:12:55,701 --> 00:12:58,479
such a wide variety
of criminal knowledge.

256
00:12:58,503 --> 00:13:02,048
Maybe Agent Keen fabricated
her quote/unquote "source"

257
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:05,085
as a way to get defendants
to cop a plea.

258
00:13:05,109 --> 00:13:06,920
There has been no fabrication,
Your Honor,

259
00:13:06,944 --> 00:13:08,688
and there is no evidence
to show that there has been.

260
00:13:08,712 --> 00:13:10,557
Not yet, but that's why you're here,

261
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,659
because I'm not prepared
to take your word on that.

262
00:13:12,683 --> 00:13:14,528
I want to hear from Agent Keen.

263
00:13:14,552 --> 00:13:15,862
Your Honor, I am

264
00:13:15,886 --> 00:13:17,697
Assistant Director
Harold Cooper of the FBI.

265
00:13:17,721 --> 00:13:20,133
I'm Agent Keen's immediate supervisor.

266
00:13:20,157 --> 00:13:22,086
Unfortunately, she's on assignment

267
00:13:22,111 --> 00:13:23,722
and unable to be here today.

268
00:13:23,746 --> 00:13:25,724
Her assignment was to show up
in my courtroom.

269
00:13:25,748 --> 00:13:27,059
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

270
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,294
How convenient.
Your Honor, this is intentional.

271
00:13:29,318 --> 00:13:32,264
Until when? How long before
she can answer my questions,

272
00:13:32,288 --> 00:13:33,766
in person and under oath?

273
00:13:33,963 --> 00:13:35,307
I honestly don't know, Your Honor.

274
00:13:35,331 --> 00:13:37,609
Well, that's not gonna cut it,
Mr. Cooper.

275
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:39,678
Have Keen here by 4:00 p.m. today.

276
00:13:39,702 --> 00:13:41,079
I can't guarantee that, Your Honor.

277
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:43,281
I can guarantee this...
If she's not here,

278
00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:44,816
I will grant the defendant's motion

279
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,086
and Mr. Veseli
may very well be released.

280
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:55,742
He's here.

281
00:13:56,651 --> 00:13:57,984
Ah.

282
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:04,083
Red, you should know,
Keen approached me last week.

283
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:05,924
She said you were dying.

284
00:14:06,527 --> 00:14:10,896
That she's the heir apparent
and I should throw in with her.

285
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,466
Did you find anything?

286
00:14:12,491 --> 00:14:13,890
No prints or DNA.

287
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:17,266
But you said the note
was left by a bank robber,

288
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,101
so I checked it against a database

289
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:23,339
of information on robberies...
Other notes, documents...

290
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:27,173
And found a handwriting match
to a previous robbery.

291
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:32,670
Thank you, Cvetko, for your work
and your loyalty.

292
00:14:34,524 --> 00:14:37,460
The Bell Tower heist in '94?

293
00:14:37,986 --> 00:14:39,085
You know it?

294
00:14:39,354 --> 00:14:42,054
I do, and the man who did it.

295
00:14:44,212 --> 00:14:46,078
Three pills, half a glass of water.

296
00:14:46,103 --> 00:14:48,304
Nothing else until I come back.

297
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,244
She's rather charmless.

298
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,498
We both know you didn't come here

299
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,800
for a skip down memory lane.

300
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:04,964
Two nights ago, I was robbed.

301
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,365
Thief left a note.

302
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:08,968
The writing matches a note
you gave a teller

303
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,470
during the Bell Tower job.

304
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,939
You think I robbed you?

305
00:15:14,105 --> 00:15:17,451
I take two steps,
I gotta rest for an hour.

306
00:15:17,475 --> 00:15:20,221
I can't even steal my wallet
out of my own pocket.

307
00:15:22,981 --> 00:15:24,406
Sorry.

308
00:15:26,534 --> 00:15:28,245
- Anything?
- We went through the names

309
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:30,238
of everyone with a safe deposit box.

310
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,340
Two weeks ago,

311
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:32,808
Terese Krissoff opened one.

312
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:35,311
Only the real Ms. Krissoff
died three months ago.

313
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:36,545
The impostor opened an account

314
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:38,280
with a fake Social Security number

315
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:39,715
so she can case the room.

316
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:41,384
The robbers avoided surveillance

317
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:42,752
when they broke into your box.

318
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,120
But we pulled a photo of Krissoff

319
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:46,295
from a week ago
when she was prepping the job.

320
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,098
We just sent you a copy of the image.

321
00:15:48,122 --> 00:15:49,966
We can't make a positive ID.

322
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,225
Can you?

323
00:15:53,964 --> 00:15:56,632
No, but I may know someone who can.

324
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,146
I was once held captive
by the Shining Path.

325
00:16:03,528 --> 00:16:07,942
Three months of unrelenting
heat and humidity

326
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,578
in the Peruvian jungle,

327
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:12,548
mixed with the occasional
round of electroshock.

328
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:15,849
All in all, it was a rather
unpleasant experience

329
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,252
but for my cellmate,

330
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:22,257
a delightfully monkish,
bookish Polish aid worker

331
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,393
who was also, inexplicably,

332
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:27,095
something of a handwriting expert.

333
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:31,500
While fending off the daily
onslaught of rhinoceros beetles,

334
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:35,386
he would hold forth
on why a child's handwriting

335
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:39,224
is often nearly identical
to that of at least one,

336
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:44,730
if not a little of both, of his
or her parents' handwriting.

337
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:48,858
Apparently, the similarity
isn't genetic at all,

338
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:52,620
just subconscious imitation.

339
00:16:55,957 --> 00:16:58,334
I didn't know you had a daughter.

340
00:16:59,282 --> 00:17:03,235
I did once. But not anymore.

341
00:17:04,629 --> 00:17:06,705
I owe you an apology.

342
00:17:07,368 --> 00:17:09,580
It's not your handwriting on the note.

343
00:17:09,604 --> 00:17:11,204
It's hers.

344
00:17:11,472 --> 00:17:14,184
You didn't rob me. She did.

345
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,886
No. That's impossible.

346
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,577
I need you to tell me where she is.

347
00:17:22,436 --> 00:17:24,050
Where is she?

348
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:28,520
Jennifer and I are estranged.

349
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:32,728
Now, I-I got those photos
from her mother.

350
00:17:32,994 --> 00:17:35,640
She and I agreed that Jen
should live with her

351
00:17:35,664 --> 00:17:39,610
s-so she could have a life, a good life.

352
00:17:39,634 --> 00:17:42,302
An honest life.

353
00:17:43,421 --> 00:17:45,321
Where is she, Abe?

354
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,902
I'm not gonna ask you again.

355
00:17:48,926 --> 00:17:52,870
I can't tell you because I don't know.

356
00:17:53,631 --> 00:17:58,661
But if you're right that
my baby's a thief, go ahead.

357
00:17:58,686 --> 00:18:00,964
You may as well kill me now,

358
00:18:00,988 --> 00:18:04,056
'cause I ain't got nothing to live for.

359
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,262
The photo Aram sent you...

360
00:18:14,286 --> 00:18:15,930
Were you able to ID the woman in it?

361
00:18:15,954 --> 00:18:17,947
Yes. The lead bore fruit.

362
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,932
So you know who robbed you,
who Elizabeth hired to rob you.

363
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,220
I do. We're looking for her now.

364
00:18:23,244 --> 00:18:24,421
We need to look together.

365
00:18:24,445 --> 00:18:25,990
After all these years, Harold,

366
00:18:26,014 --> 00:18:28,492
I would think you'd know
I don't do halfsies.

367
00:18:28,516 --> 00:18:30,661
If we don't find Elizabeth
by 4:00 p.m. today,

368
00:18:30,685 --> 00:18:33,797
the case we made against
Alban Veseli will fall apart.

369
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,697
- Alban. The Freelancer.
- Yes.

370
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,224
And he has a new attorney

371
00:18:37,248 --> 00:18:38,969
who claims we violated his civil rights

372
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,238
by not disclosing
that you were our source.

373
00:18:41,262 --> 00:18:43,774
If Elizabeth doesn't appear
in court to defend the case,

374
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:45,542
the judge may let him walk.

375
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:48,701
So are we doing halfsies or what?

376
00:18:50,638 --> 00:18:51,882
The woman we're looking for...

377
00:18:51,906 --> 00:18:53,784
Her name is Jennifer Anne Moores.

378
00:18:53,808 --> 00:18:56,620
According to Reddington, she's
the daughter of Abraham Moores.

379
00:18:56,644 --> 00:18:59,256
Reddington claims Moores
is a retired bank robber.

380
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,858
Like father like daughter.

381
00:19:00,882 --> 00:19:03,627
Moores was arrested in '98,
did nine years and retired.

382
00:19:03,651 --> 00:19:06,436
Or maybe passed on the family
business to his daughter.

383
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,098
Reddington doesn't think so.

384
00:19:08,122 --> 00:19:09,767
He says the last thing the father wanted

385
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,835
was for his daughter
to follow in his footsteps.

386
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,971
He told her that. They became estranged.

387
00:19:13,995 --> 00:19:15,939
Reddington doesn't think he
knows where the daughter is.

388
00:19:15,963 --> 00:19:20,144
The DMV database shows
637 Jennifer Anne Moores.

389
00:19:20,168 --> 00:19:22,746
But once I cross-check that

390
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,948
against the photo
we got from the bank...

391
00:19:24,972 --> 00:19:26,917
We got her address.

392
00:19:26,941 --> 00:19:29,186
And her occupation...
Well, alleged occupation

393
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,221
since I doubt she's gonna list
"bank robber"

394
00:19:31,245 --> 00:19:32,623
on her mortgage application.

395
00:19:32,647 --> 00:19:34,291
I want teams at her home and work.

396
00:19:34,315 --> 00:19:35,292
Should we bring her in?

397
00:19:35,316 --> 00:19:36,560
No, I want her followed.

398
00:19:36,584 --> 00:19:39,229
Hopefully to Elizabeth Keen.

399
00:19:47,862 --> 00:19:50,107
- Aram, what's up with your audio?
- I don't know.

400
00:19:50,131 --> 00:19:51,930
I'm getting some nasty
frequency interference.

401
00:19:51,954 --> 00:19:53,010
Hang on.

402
00:19:54,969 --> 00:19:56,980
That's the second call
she's had in five minutes.

403
00:19:57,004 --> 00:19:58,182
What's she up to?

404
00:19:58,206 --> 00:20:01,318
The whole thing's sort of
a double-edged sword, isn't it?

405
00:20:01,342 --> 00:20:02,686
What whole thing?

406
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,088
This business with Keen.

407
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,697
And The Freelancer. Him getting out.

408
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:08,058
The guy derailed a train,
killed 60 innocents

409
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,693
in an attempt to hide one murder.

410
00:20:09,717 --> 00:20:11,598
- He's not getting out.
- He may if Keen doesn't show.

411
00:20:11,622 --> 00:20:12,830
He could walk.

412
00:20:12,854 --> 00:20:14,465
On the other hand, if she does show,

413
00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:18,102
the killer stays in prison,
but we're forced to arrest Keen.

414
00:20:18,126 --> 00:20:19,103
Double-edged sword.

415
00:20:19,127 --> 00:20:21,138
Well, at this point,
all we have are bad options,

416
00:20:21,162 --> 00:20:24,541
so arresting her may be
the best bad one we've got.

417
00:20:24,565 --> 00:20:25,809
You haven't been able to yet.

418
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,144
Yeah, but with the way things are going,

419
00:20:27,168 --> 00:20:29,486
that might be the only way
to keep her safe.

420
00:20:30,204 --> 00:20:32,583
Now, who's this here?

421
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:33,751
Think he's part of her crew?

422
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,185
Aram, where's that audio?

423
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:37,588
Nasty frequency interference. Hang on.

424
00:20:40,748 --> 00:20:42,059
Oop. Hang on.

425
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,561
We got someone else now.
Female to the south.

426
00:20:44,585 --> 00:20:45,963
Aram, we need that audio.

427
00:20:45,987 --> 00:20:47,598
Okay. Just, um... Alright.

428
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:51,168
Give me 20 seconds,
and I will get you sound.

429
00:20:57,585 --> 00:20:59,852
What the hell is he doing?

430
00:21:00,735 --> 00:21:02,012
We're not supposed to meet

431
00:21:02,036 --> 00:21:04,137
until I deliver the drive to the client.

432
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:05,597
We have a problem.

433
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,185
Reddington showed up
at your father's apartment.

434
00:21:08,209 --> 00:21:10,654
Raymond Reddington?
You're sure it was him?

435
00:21:10,678 --> 00:21:13,846
I knew this was a mistake. Let me think.

436
00:21:14,377 --> 00:21:16,021
What's the move, Jen?

437
00:21:21,389 --> 00:21:22,900
Oh, excuse me. Uh, s-sorry.

438
00:21:22,924 --> 00:21:25,202
Uh, did you guys happen to see,
uh, a woman walk by,

439
00:21:25,226 --> 00:21:28,539
about, um, 5'7", uh, dark...
Uh, dark curly hair,

440
00:21:28,563 --> 00:21:31,875
uh, super smart and funny,
so really... she's really funny.

441
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:34,411
We haven't seen anyone. Sorry.

442
00:21:34,435 --> 00:21:36,362
Thanks anyway. It's just, um...

443
00:21:36,904 --> 00:21:39,216
I can't remember if I was
supposed to meet her at 1:00

444
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,250
and I'm super early

445
00:21:40,274 --> 00:21:43,654
or noon and I just, like,
totally stood her up.

446
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,756
You could just text her?

447
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,858
I can text her. I can text her.
I'll text her.

448
00:21:47,882 --> 00:21:50,260
Oh! I'm sorry!

449
00:21:50,284 --> 00:21:52,729
Such an idiot. Sorry.

450
00:21:54,055 --> 00:21:55,999
Oh, my God.

451
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,735
- Spilling all the sugar.
- It's fine.

452
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:00,893
Okay. Thanks.

453
00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:06,053
What exactly did Reddington say?

454
00:22:06,077 --> 00:22:09,261
He asked your dad about you.
About the job.

455
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:12,532
If he finds us, you know
he's gonna kill us, right?

456
00:22:12,556 --> 00:22:13,941
What do you want to do?

457
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:16,637
Call Reddington and say you're sorry,

458
00:22:16,661 --> 00:22:18,072
that you'll give it back?

459
00:22:18,096 --> 00:22:19,240
What's done is done.

460
00:22:19,264 --> 00:22:21,548
We need to split up. Lay low.

461
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:24,762
Yes, but not until after
we deliver the drive to Givins

462
00:22:24,786 --> 00:22:26,564
and we get paid.

463
00:22:26,588 --> 00:22:28,833
- Givins.
- You know that name?

464
00:22:28,857 --> 00:22:31,791
Carolyn Givins.
It's one of Keen's aliases.

465
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:36,056
Carolyn. It's me.

466
00:22:36,331 --> 00:22:37,942
I need to move up the meet.

467
00:22:37,966 --> 00:22:39,983
Peirce Mill in Rock Creek Park,

468
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,295
3:00 p.m.

469
00:22:44,622 --> 00:22:46,300
All worked out.

470
00:22:47,892 --> 00:22:49,437
Cooper.

471
00:22:49,461 --> 00:22:51,972
Jennifer Moores is making
the drop to Keen today.

472
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:54,008
- Do you have the location?
- Rock Creek Park.

473
00:22:54,032 --> 00:22:55,810
We're getting units in place now.

474
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:58,079
The moment she's in custody,
bring her here.

475
00:22:58,103 --> 00:23:01,315
And, Agent Ressler, let's keep
this an internal matter.

476
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:05,543
We can notify Reddington once
Keen's safe and in our custody.

477
00:23:18,249 --> 00:23:20,316
We've got movement.

478
00:23:20,341 --> 00:23:21,974
Unit 1, hang back a bit.

479
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:38,018
Did you see that?

480
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,286
All teams, report.

481
00:23:39,443 --> 00:23:40,954
Unit 1, clear.

482
00:23:40,978 --> 00:23:43,429
Unit 2, holding
just south of the location.

483
00:23:44,081 --> 00:23:46,059
Your drop's blown.

484
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,544
What? No.

485
00:23:47,568 --> 00:23:49,846
If Reddington's people knew,
I'd be dead by now.

486
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,081
It's not Reddington.

487
00:23:51,105 --> 00:23:52,705
It's the FBI.

488
00:23:54,075 --> 00:23:55,519
Who's she talking with?

489
00:23:55,543 --> 00:23:57,461
This has gotta be it.

490
00:23:57,778 --> 00:23:59,089
Check your account.

491
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:06,853
Okay. I have the funds.

492
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:08,422
Where are you? I have your drive.

493
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,058
Slow down. Listen to me.

494
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:12,527
If you want a shot
at staying outta prison,

495
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:15,130
I need you to do exactly as I say.

496
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:24,339
Park. 7:00.

497
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:26,508
The woman in the red jacket.

498
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:28,910
Copy. Unit 1, you have eyes?

499
00:24:35,732 --> 00:24:37,576
All units, move in now.

500
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,045
Jennifer Moores. FBI.

501
00:24:39,069 --> 00:24:40,514
You're under arrest.

502
00:24:40,538 --> 00:24:43,005
FBI! Hands in the air! Hands!

503
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:46,862
What's going on? What did I do?

504
00:24:46,886 --> 00:24:48,063
- Stand still.
- Don't move.

505
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:49,297
Don't move.

506
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,499
Put your hands behind your back.

507
00:24:50,523 --> 00:24:51,500
Do you have anything in your pockets?

508
00:24:51,524 --> 00:24:53,368
Park, what have you got?

509
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:55,170
Nothing. Pack's empty.

510
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:56,772
Empty? You sure?

511
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,691
The coffee cup.

512
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,401
Where's the cup?

513
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:29,471
I know you. How you operate.

514
00:25:29,678 --> 00:25:30,822
She'll be here.

515
00:25:30,846 --> 00:25:32,323
The way you handle Reddington

516
00:25:32,347 --> 00:25:34,826
while all the while letting him
think he's handling you.

517
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,894
The velvet shiv you use
to get your agents

518
00:25:36,918 --> 00:25:38,663
to do what you need in a way
that makes them feel

519
00:25:38,687 --> 00:25:40,498
like they can do what they want.

520
00:25:40,522 --> 00:25:43,134
Harold, you are a wonder to behold.

521
00:25:43,158 --> 00:25:44,435
No one could've done what you've done

522
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,870
these past seven years.

523
00:25:45,894 --> 00:25:48,206
Yet here you are,
steaming up like a tea kettle,

524
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,375
and I want to know why.

525
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:52,277
What's going on with Agent Keen?

526
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:53,444
I can't tell you that.

527
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,904
And I can't protect you if you don't.

528
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,473
And believe me when I tell you,

529
00:25:57,497 --> 00:25:59,942
if the criminals you've arrested
start getting released,

530
00:25:59,966 --> 00:26:01,277
you're gonna need more protection

531
00:26:01,301 --> 00:26:04,035
than a pair of teens
in the back of papa's car.

532
00:26:07,501 --> 00:26:09,084
Let me get this straight.

533
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,120
I ordered Agent Keen to appear.
She didn't.

534
00:26:11,144 --> 00:26:13,656
I gave her a second chance
to comply. She hasn't.

535
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,458
Your Honor, may we approach?

536
00:26:20,754 --> 00:26:23,015
- Who is this?
- Cynthia Panabaker, Your Honor.

537
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,406
White House Counsel.

538
00:26:24,605 --> 00:26:26,550
If we could talk to Your Honor ex parte,

539
00:26:26,574 --> 00:26:28,185
make a proffer for your ears only,

540
00:26:28,209 --> 00:26:29,686
maybe we can move things along.

541
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,988
Absolutely not. Your Honor...

542
00:26:31,012 --> 00:26:32,790
It's the only way
this happens, Your Honor.

543
00:26:32,814 --> 00:26:34,057
You're in the dark.

544
00:26:34,081 --> 00:26:35,259
You want to release a mass-murderer

545
00:26:35,283 --> 00:26:36,794
because you don't have information?

546
00:26:36,818 --> 00:26:38,864
Do it. See how that works out for you.

547
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:42,254
Or grant our request
and step into the light.

548
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:46,336
I'll clear the courtroom
and hear the proffer.

549
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,005
Relax, Mr. Rovenpor.

550
00:26:48,029 --> 00:26:49,792
Once I hear the truth,
I'll make a ruling

551
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:52,219
about what, if anything,
stays privileged.

552
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:55,266
Bailiff, please clear the court.

553
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,683
All rise. Court is in recess.

554
00:27:04,573 --> 00:27:06,339
This better be good.

555
00:27:06,364 --> 00:27:07,697
Raymond Reddington

556
00:27:07,729 --> 00:27:10,129
is Agent Keen's confidential informant.

557
00:27:10,561 --> 00:27:12,439
That's right. The President is aware.

558
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,109
So is a very small handful
of federal agents.

559
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,477
And now the list includes you.

560
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:18,446
You're telling me
the United States government

561
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,848
is willingly in business
with Raymond Reddington?

562
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:23,985
You're not the first person
to express... some concern.

563
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,553
Oh, I'm not concerned. I'm offended.

564
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,413
You don't find many swans
swimming in the sewer.

565
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,649
Reddington's the source
behind all these cases,

566
00:27:30,673 --> 00:27:33,252
the one feeding Agent Keen
a steady diet of major criminals

567
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,853
for the last seven-plus years?

568
00:27:34,877 --> 00:27:38,090
You can understand why we need
to keep that from being exposed.

569
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,425
We didn't want you to think
we were simply

570
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,026
refusing to comply with the court...

571
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,394
You don't think you had an obligation

572
00:27:42,418 --> 00:27:43,829
to inform those defendants

573
00:27:43,853 --> 00:27:45,597
that the source of the intel
used against them

574
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,666
was maybe the most prolific
criminal mastermind

575
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:48,868
in modern world history?

576
00:27:48,892 --> 00:27:50,436
Express your distaste all you want,

577
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,638
but three presidents have come
to a different conclusion.

578
00:27:52,662 --> 00:27:54,849
We didn't come back here
for your moral judgment.

579
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:56,090
Then here's my legal judgment.

580
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,270
I find anything the FBI learned
from Reddington

581
00:27:58,294 --> 00:27:59,838
with regard to this defendant

582
00:27:59,862 --> 00:28:01,907
to be unreliable as a matter of law.

583
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:03,441
All evidence that came from him

584
00:28:03,465 --> 00:28:05,576
or was the fruit
of the relationship with him

585
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,346
should have been declared inadmissible.

586
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,647
- Your Honor, please.
- Absent that evidence,

587
00:28:08,671 --> 00:28:10,115
does the government
have sufficient proof

588
00:28:10,139 --> 00:28:11,583
to make its case against Mr. Veseli?

589
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:13,719
We'd need time before
answering that, Your Honor.

590
00:28:13,743 --> 00:28:14,953
That's too bad, 'cause time's up.

591
00:28:14,977 --> 00:28:16,555
I am granting the defendant's motion

592
00:28:16,579 --> 00:28:18,255
to withdraw his guilty plea,

593
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,325
and I am forced to dismiss
the charges against him.

594
00:28:21,349 --> 00:28:24,020
Don't do this.
I'm not doing it, Mr. Cooper.

595
00:28:24,044 --> 00:28:25,529
You are.

596
00:28:34,195 --> 00:28:36,398
He's in for a pleasant surprise.

597
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,668
It'll take a few hours for
the prison to process him out.

598
00:28:38,692 --> 00:28:40,637
I'll do what I can to slow that down.

599
00:28:40,661 --> 00:28:42,672
- What good will that do?
- I'll take another look.

600
00:28:42,696 --> 00:28:45,241
It's a long shot,
but maybe there's enough

601
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:46,409
to hold him on another charge.

602
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,587
In the meantime, find Keen.

603
00:28:48,611 --> 00:28:50,313
We have Jennifer Moores in custody.

604
00:28:50,337 --> 00:28:52,315
Now, I don't know who Miss Moores is

605
00:28:52,339 --> 00:28:54,117
or how she can lead you to Keen,

606
00:28:54,141 --> 00:28:56,486
but if you don't bring her in
soon, you're on your own.

607
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,754
If this is gonna blow up,

608
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:00,278
I won't be the one
jumping on any grenades.

609
00:29:03,725 --> 00:29:05,525
Well, I wouldn't say
it was a total loss.

610
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,749
Did you get Elizabeth?

611
00:29:06,774 --> 00:29:08,874
Well, no. Uh, not exactly.

612
00:29:08,899 --> 00:29:11,000
Was your goal to get Elizabeth?

613
00:29:11,567 --> 00:29:12,899
Okay, it was a-a total loss.

614
00:29:12,924 --> 00:29:15,258
But on the plus side,
we got her associates.

615
00:29:15,283 --> 00:29:17,439
I sent you their photos
to see if you can ID them.

616
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:18,908
So now you want my help.

617
00:29:18,955 --> 00:29:20,746
Harold has a unique definition of

618
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:22,034
halfsies.

619
00:29:22,058 --> 00:29:24,336
Halfsies? I love halfsies.

620
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,746
Especially for food.

621
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,978
Tell him that I don't recognize
anyone in the photos

622
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:33,280
and that the next time
he has actionable intel,

623
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:34,815
I expect him to share it with me

624
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:37,084
before it's squandered, not after.

625
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,426
You lied to me, Abe.

626
00:29:46,878 --> 00:29:49,623
Raymond, I told you what I knew.

627
00:29:49,648 --> 00:29:51,098
Really?

628
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:55,359
Then why didn't you tell me
about your nurse?

629
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,322
Let's try this again.

630
00:30:11,869 --> 00:30:14,136
Talk to me about your daughter.

631
00:30:24,612 --> 00:30:27,676
No pressure, but getting Moores
to give us a lead on Keen

632
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:30,385
is all that stands between
Veseli and his release.

633
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,887
I thought the judge ordered his release.

634
00:30:31,911 --> 00:30:33,489
She did, but Panabaker
thinks she can keep him

635
00:30:33,513 --> 00:30:35,491
from being processed out
before the end of the day.

636
00:30:35,515 --> 00:30:36,826
If we can find Keen by then,

637
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:38,661
maybe we can get the order stayed.

638
00:30:38,685 --> 00:30:39,929
Why don't we start by talking

639
00:30:39,953 --> 00:30:41,964
about your options here, Ms. Moore?

640
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,277
- How about the lawyer option?
- Yeah, we can do that.

641
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,212
And they can tell you
you're looking at 20 years.

642
00:30:46,236 --> 00:30:49,415
Or they can tell me that without
any evidence or witnesses,

643
00:30:49,439 --> 00:30:50,950
I should keep my mouth shut.

644
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,987
Yeah. You're right.
We don't have any witnesses.

645
00:30:54,011 --> 00:30:56,823
But what we do have are
your friends that we picked up.

646
00:30:56,847 --> 00:30:58,625
Your, uh, co-conspirators.

647
00:30:58,649 --> 00:30:59,993
Co-conspirator?

648
00:31:00,017 --> 00:31:01,995
I don't know what you're talking about.

649
00:31:02,019 --> 00:31:04,063
How can I be a co-conspirator
if I don't know the woman?

650
00:31:04,087 --> 00:31:05,528
She sure knows you.

651
00:31:05,552 --> 00:31:07,700
At least, she seemed to when
we recorded the three of you

652
00:31:07,724 --> 00:31:09,602
meeting at True Cafe.

653
00:31:09,626 --> 00:31:11,304
I'm done talking.

654
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:12,705
Raf's not.

655
00:31:12,729 --> 00:31:14,274
Raf's got plenty to say.

656
00:31:14,298 --> 00:31:15,608
About you.

657
00:31:15,632 --> 00:31:16,976
Jennifer.

658
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,478
How you met through her father.

659
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:19,479
That's a lie.

660
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:20,914
No, it's the truth.

661
00:31:20,938 --> 00:31:22,448
Silvina spent every day with him.

662
00:31:22,472 --> 00:31:23,683
She's his live-in nurse.

663
00:31:23,707 --> 00:31:25,118
How could they not know each other?

664
00:31:25,142 --> 00:31:27,453
- Did Silvina say that?
- You leave my father out of this.

665
00:31:27,477 --> 00:31:30,023
Your father is a legendary thief
and a safe-cracker,

666
00:31:30,047 --> 00:31:32,525
and you don't expect us
to overlook that, did you?

667
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:34,527
He went to prison when I was 7.

668
00:31:34,551 --> 00:31:36,329
Okay. Enough already.

669
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:37,730
She's your daughter.

670
00:31:37,754 --> 00:31:39,766
I never wanted this life for her.

671
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:42,001
She's the first thing
you think of every morning.

672
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:45,004
Which is why I thought it best
to stay away from her,

673
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,040
even after I got out of prison.

674
00:31:47,064 --> 00:31:48,875
I cut ties.

675
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:51,511
You can't imagine how hard that is.

676
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:52,879
For the purposes of this conversation,

677
00:31:52,903 --> 00:31:54,453
let's assume I can.

678
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:57,099
I hated the man.
He walked out of my life.

679
00:31:57,274 --> 00:31:58,451
He abandoned me.

680
00:31:58,475 --> 00:32:00,954
Until one day, I walked back in.

681
00:32:00,978 --> 00:32:05,425
Not to be with her,
you know, not to talk.

682
00:32:05,449 --> 00:32:06,693
Just...

683
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:08,528
Just to see her.

684
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:10,029
And what did you see?

685
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:13,233
I saw my kid crack the Vaultsafe 200

686
00:32:13,257 --> 00:32:18,104
of a two-bit meth dealer
in under four minutes.

687
00:32:18,128 --> 00:32:21,741
She was unrefined,
a little rushed, but...

688
00:32:21,765 --> 00:32:23,576
God, she had the touch.

689
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,280
Even if I knew where he was,
I wouldn't talk.

690
00:32:27,304 --> 00:32:28,654
He's an old man.

691
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:31,683
I should have called the police
right then and there.

692
00:32:32,175 --> 00:32:33,653
But she was your child.

693
00:32:33,677 --> 00:32:36,155
I figured I had something to teach her.

694
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:37,624
To share with her.

695
00:32:37,648 --> 00:32:38,992
A reason to be in her life.

696
00:32:39,016 --> 00:32:42,352
Is that what he told you?
Well, he's lying.

697
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:45,123
I think he's still
very much involved in your life.

698
00:32:45,147 --> 00:32:48,593
In fact, Raf says he's the one
who selects the targets.

699
00:32:48,617 --> 00:32:50,061
Of course I did.

700
00:32:50,085 --> 00:32:52,864
She needed marks who
wouldn't report the crime,

701
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,096
and I knew where to find them.

702
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,575
You certainly found me.

703
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:59,350
Now, wait... I told her
that you were off-limits.

704
00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:01,046
I did, Raymond.

705
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:03,382
But she wouldn't listen
because of the money.

706
00:33:03,406 --> 00:33:04,783
It was a lot of money.

707
00:33:04,807 --> 00:33:06,318
The job was a contract.

708
00:33:06,342 --> 00:33:07,641
Yes. A woman.

709
00:33:08,262 --> 00:33:09,554
Uh, some American.

710
00:33:09,578 --> 00:33:12,234
- Tell me about her.
- Only on one condition.

711
00:33:12,258 --> 00:33:14,074
You leave my father out of this.

712
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,419
Tell me about the woman.

713
00:33:15,443 --> 00:33:16,854
They met through an acquaintance.

714
00:33:16,878 --> 00:33:19,598
Jennifer said she was
laying low after a job.

715
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,434
Cape Town. Didn't have anywhere to go.

716
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,470
But Jen found this safe house.

717
00:33:23,494 --> 00:33:24,905
Part of a network.

718
00:33:24,929 --> 00:33:27,841
Sanctuaries for criminals
on every continent.

719
00:33:27,865 --> 00:33:31,111
Anyway, the woman who runs it,
her name's Vee.

720
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:32,679
She's the one who approached me.

721
00:33:32,703 --> 00:33:35,315
She said she had a client
at another safe house

722
00:33:35,339 --> 00:33:36,516
who needed a job done.

723
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,618
Said she was raiding a safe deposit box

724
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,020
and it had to be done quickly,

725
00:33:40,044 --> 00:33:43,189
so she and Jennifer met in D.C.

726
00:33:43,213 --> 00:33:44,190
Talked about the job.

727
00:33:44,214 --> 00:33:45,859
She said it was personal.

728
00:33:45,883 --> 00:33:47,761
That she was targeting
Raymond Reddington.

729
00:33:47,785 --> 00:33:49,930
She said that you were more vulnerable

730
00:33:49,954 --> 00:33:51,865
than anyone might believe

731
00:33:51,889 --> 00:33:53,934
and that she was building an alliance.

732
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:57,337
And that when this was over,
when Reddington was dead,

733
00:33:57,361 --> 00:33:58,505
that she'd be in my debt.

734
00:33:58,529 --> 00:34:00,040
I told her not to do it.

735
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:05,045
But this woman, whoever she is,
she had on blinders.

736
00:34:05,069 --> 00:34:08,748
She had money,
and she was persuasive.

737
00:34:08,772 --> 00:34:10,233
When they met.

738
00:34:11,241 --> 00:34:13,612
Where the woman was laying low.

739
00:34:13,944 --> 00:34:15,221
Do you know where that was?

740
00:34:15,245 --> 00:34:18,091
Of course I do. And I can tell you.

741
00:34:18,115 --> 00:34:20,560
But again, I want assurances.

742
00:34:20,584 --> 00:34:22,796
You keep my father out of this.

743
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:27,133
Raymond, lay this at my feet,
not at Jennifer's.

744
00:34:27,157 --> 00:34:28,888
She's just a kid.

745
00:34:28,912 --> 00:34:30,792
My girl.

746
00:34:31,213 --> 00:34:32,881
Your girl.

747
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,203
My baby girl.

748
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:42,156
We got it. Keen's safe house.

749
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,591
It's an address in Deanwood.

750
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:44,499
We're sending units now.

751
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,643
No, wait.

752
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,044
Reddington. What is it?

753
00:34:47,068 --> 00:34:48,812
Greetings, Harold.
Text me the address.

754
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,546
I'm calling to see how your crack team

755
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:51,757
is doing with the prisoners.

756
00:34:51,781 --> 00:34:54,227
Moores and her associates have
invoked their right to counsel.

757
00:34:54,251 --> 00:34:55,628
They're refusing to talk.

758
00:34:55,652 --> 00:34:57,196
That's predictably unfortunate.

759
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,265
Have you heard differently?
Any news on your end?

760
00:34:59,289 --> 00:35:01,534
I wish I had something
to tell you, Harold.

761
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:04,203
Let me know if your prisoners
decide to talk.

762
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,204
I'll do that.

763
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,706
What's going on? You going alone?

764
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,174
It's probably hubris,

765
00:35:08,198 --> 00:35:10,510
but I still think
I might be able to reach her.

766
00:35:21,811 --> 00:35:23,556
Agent Keen. It's Harold Cooper.

767
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,066
I'm alone.

768
00:35:26,162 --> 00:35:27,628
I just want to talk.

769
00:35:31,623 --> 00:35:33,533
Open the door, Elizabeth.

770
00:35:39,062 --> 00:35:40,907
I'm afraid we're too late, Harold.

771
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:43,097
It appears she's already gone.

772
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:52,713
The photos we sent.

773
00:35:52,737 --> 00:35:55,241
You said you didn't recognize anyone
that wasn't true, was it?

774
00:35:55,287 --> 00:35:59,262
No, Silvina Rosario works
for Abraham Moores.

775
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:01,312
Once I saw her in the photos

776
00:36:01,337 --> 00:36:04,224
I knew Abe had lied and
could easily be persuaded

777
00:36:04,248 --> 00:36:06,247
to tell me what he knew.

778
00:36:06,271 --> 00:36:09,086
Perhaps you should have share
that information with us sooner

779
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:10,778
Elizabeth wouldn't have eluded us.

780
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:14,015
Sins, stones, and glass houses, Harold.

781
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:16,851
Neither of us has played fair
with the other.

782
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:19,320
Now, seeing as how your job description

783
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:22,623
is to play fair and mine is to not,

784
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:24,783
then an argument could be made

785
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:28,054
that you're slightly more at
fault than I, but why quibble?

786
00:36:28,078 --> 00:36:31,424
Elizabeth's gone and she's taken
something of mine with her.

787
00:36:31,448 --> 00:36:34,694
I couldn't be less interested
in what she stole from you.

788
00:36:34,718 --> 00:36:36,329
My sole concern is her well-being

789
00:36:36,353 --> 00:36:38,131
and getting her back to help her
heal from the wound

790
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:40,600
that you caused
when you killed her mother.

791
00:36:40,624 --> 00:36:43,202
We are each responsible
for the choices we make.

792
00:36:43,226 --> 00:36:45,338
Elizabeth has made hers.

793
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:48,515
She's responsible for it, not me.

794
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,685
I suppose you also think
that she's responsible

795
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,220
for The Freelancer's release,

796
00:36:52,244 --> 00:36:54,516
which now that we're here and she's not,

797
00:36:54,552 --> 00:36:55,872
is guaranteed to happen.

798
00:36:55,896 --> 00:36:58,059
I think she's not only
responsible for it,

799
00:36:58,083 --> 00:36:59,727
I think it's what she wants.

800
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:01,195
That's absurd.

801
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:05,566
One day, Elizabeth steals
millions of dollars from me,

802
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:10,538
and next, The Freelancer has
a brand-new expensive attorney

803
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,080
demanding his release

804
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:16,953
unless Elizabeth Keen
magically appears in court.

805
00:37:16,977 --> 00:37:19,722
That doesn't strike me
as absurd, Harold.

806
00:37:19,746 --> 00:37:22,546
That strikes me as unsettling.

807
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:25,428
I stalled as long as I could,

808
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:27,296
but Veseli's out on bond.

809
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,799
So you're out of time,
and I am out of patience.

810
00:37:29,823 --> 00:37:32,590
What aren't you telling me about Keen?

811
00:37:34,807 --> 00:37:36,894
She wants to kill Reddington.

812
00:37:37,564 --> 00:37:40,147
Which is why he's put her
on the Blacklist.

813
00:37:41,324 --> 00:37:44,037
Elizabeth Keen is on the Blacklist.

814
00:37:46,106 --> 00:37:48,339
Maybe I ought to start at the beginning.

815
00:37:50,342 --> 00:37:51,825
Mr. Hadley.

816
00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:54,223
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

817
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,794
Unmarked? As discussed?

818
00:38:03,316 --> 00:38:04,516
Where is he?

819
00:38:25,343 --> 00:38:27,628
You're the lawyer? The one
who's representing Keen?

820
00:38:27,652 --> 00:38:30,241
There's a number pre-programmed.
You ask for Charlotte.

821
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:33,984
You tell them you got caught
in the rain and need to dry off.

822
00:38:34,566 --> 00:38:37,611
Keen put me in prison.
Why is she helping me now?

823
00:38:37,674 --> 00:38:39,386
Miss Keen arranged for your release

824
00:38:39,411 --> 00:38:41,511
because she requires your services.

825
00:38:45,348 --> 00:38:46,592
What does she need me to do?

826
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:48,999
For now? Nothing.

827
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,487
"You got caught in the rain..."

828
00:38:52,511 --> 00:38:53,632
"And need to dry off."

829
00:39:36,132 --> 00:39:38,044
Edward confirmed it.

830
00:39:38,443 --> 00:39:41,077
She flew on a private jet out of Dulles.

831
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:45,392
Then she's gone.

832
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,261
The thumb drive with her.

833
00:39:47,285 --> 00:39:49,200
What will she do with it?

834
00:39:49,962 --> 00:39:51,627
Nothing good.

835
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,582
We need to inform
our friend in the East.

836
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:57,560
I'll arrange the meeting.

837
00:39:59,224 --> 00:40:01,758
Dembe, let me out up there, would you?

838
00:40:04,966 --> 00:40:06,676
Where are you going?

839
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:09,505
Clear my head, get some air.

840
00:40:18,339 --> 00:40:20,310
Do you mind if I join you?

841
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:21,579
Not at all.

842
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:31,813
You're just in time.

843
00:40:32,204 --> 00:40:33,760
There's a Cape May Warbler

844
00:40:33,784 --> 00:40:36,451
who usually starts up right about now.

845
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,380
Do we know each other?

846
00:40:39,405 --> 00:40:41,171
I don't believe so.

847
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:43,336
- Should I know you?
- No, no, no.

848
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,728
I was just curious if we'd ever met.

849
00:40:52,602 --> 00:40:53,851
I'm Anne.

850
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,033
Raymond.

851
00:40:59,259 --> 00:41:00,858
Well, now we've met.

852
00:41:03,426 --> 00:41:04,529
Yes.

853
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:47,583
Sir.

854
00:41:49,843 --> 00:41:51,754
She's really gone, isn't she?

855
00:41:53,369 --> 00:41:55,568
Agent Keen?

856
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:58,330
I, uh...

857
00:41:58,376 --> 00:42:00,840
I was up all night thinking about it.

858
00:42:00,864 --> 00:42:02,504
I mean...

859
00:42:03,427 --> 00:42:04,622
I mean, I know she's gone,

860
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:09,499
but then I find myself
hoping she isn't, you know?

861
00:42:13,306 --> 00:42:15,245
You think we'll ever hear from her?

862
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:20,406
I'm fairly confident we haven't
heard the last of Agent Keen.
