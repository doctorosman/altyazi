1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,793
The Blacklist'te daha önce...

2
00:00:01,903 --> 00:00:04,273
Ben getir götürcü değilim.
Sipariş almam.

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:07,171
Bunu ortadan kaldırmanı istiyoruz.

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,894
Keen'in neler söylediğini biliyoruz.

5
00:00:09,918 --> 00:00:11,429
Senin N-13 olduğunu söylüyor.

6
00:00:11,453 --> 00:00:13,397
Elizabeth gitti ve bana ait

7
00:00:13,421 --> 00:00:14,932
bir şeyi de yanında götürdü.

8
00:00:14,956 --> 00:00:17,201
Sanıyorum ki Serbest Çalışan'ın
salınmasından

9
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:18,436
onu sorumlu tutuyorsun.

10
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,271
Hikayenin her zaman bir devamı var.

11
00:00:20,295 --> 00:00:22,073
- Where is he?
- The work of a man

12
00:00:22,097 --> 00:00:23,441
who disguises his killings

13
00:00:23,465 --> 00:00:25,610
in the headlines of everyday tragedies.

14
00:00:25,634 --> 00:00:28,846
The arrest that you
made earlier. Mason Dieterle.

15
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,648
He burned down my friend's restaurant.

16
00:00:30,672 --> 00:00:33,684
I just got off the phone with
the AUSA reviewing the case.

17
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:36,387
He told me that your friend
passed away from her injuries.

18
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,888
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:40,057
You promised me you wouldn't
do anything to Dieterle.

20
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:43,094
I need to know...
Did you break that promise?

21
00:00:45,327 --> 00:00:47,406
No, sir.

22
00:00:49,858 --> 00:00:51,335
We've been formulating

23
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:53,064
those binary structures
you gave us for weeks

24
00:00:53,088 --> 00:00:55,730
and... I think we've done it.

25
00:00:55,798 --> 00:00:58,643
We identified the exact
structure of the Novichok agent.

26
00:01:00,702 --> 00:01:04,248
Pig, hog, runt...

27
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,484
sow...

28
00:01:06,508 --> 00:01:07,968
boar.

29
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,836
My brother's mantra.

30
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,372
When he was a boy,
he collected glass pigs.

31
00:01:13,396 --> 00:01:16,268
He knew everything
there was to know about them.

32
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:18,477
Which side-group is this?

33
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:21,080
Ethoxy. It's more stable.

34
00:01:21,104 --> 00:01:23,749
Easier to spread. Harder to detect.

35
00:01:23,773 --> 00:01:26,485
And lethal when it contacts the skin.

36
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,636
This compound is 10 times
more potent than VX.

37
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,504
If there's a deadlier
nerve agent on Earth,

38
00:01:45,528 --> 00:01:47,072
I'm not aware of it.

39
00:01:47,096 --> 00:01:49,508
Call our buyer in Durres.

40
00:01:49,532 --> 00:01:51,510
Tell him the order's ready

41
00:01:51,534 --> 00:01:53,746
and to expect delivery in 48 hours.

42
00:01:58,508 --> 00:02:01,520
Pig, hog, runt...

43
00:02:01,544 --> 00:02:03,322
sow...

44
00:02:03,346 --> 00:02:05,012
boar.

46
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:25,879
The road not taken.

47
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:27,913
- Beauty school?
- Yes.

48
00:02:27,937 --> 00:02:30,416
That young woman's great passion

49
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,519
that her single father
just can't understand.

50
00:02:33,543 --> 00:02:35,389
It pushes them apart.

51
00:02:35,912 --> 00:02:39,024
But instead of insisting
that she understand him,

52
00:02:39,048 --> 00:02:41,560
he enrolls in beauty school as well

53
00:02:41,584 --> 00:02:45,097
and learns to better understand her.

54
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:47,566
I think you understand Elizabeth.

55
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,653
Probably more than you want to.

56
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,698
Well, I'm not her father.

57
00:02:53,963 --> 00:02:57,943
Maybe if I were, I'd want to
understand her even better.

58
00:02:57,967 --> 00:03:00,279
Perhaps she wouldn't be
so determined to kill me.

59
00:03:05,575 --> 00:03:07,520
- Morning, Dembe.
- Good morning.

60
00:03:07,544 --> 00:03:09,822
- Coffee?
- Please.

61
00:03:09,846 --> 00:03:11,524
Something smells delicious.

62
00:03:11,548 --> 00:03:13,092
Mmm. Meat and potato pie.

63
00:03:13,116 --> 00:03:16,595
Dembe brought it back from Sarajevo.

64
00:03:16,619 --> 00:03:18,640
You should try a slice.

65
00:03:19,322 --> 00:03:23,135
Like all good things,
it's sinfully bad for you.

66
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,737
You said you had a case?

67
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:26,772
Yes. Thanks to Dembe.

68
00:03:26,796 --> 00:03:29,475
He brought home more than Bosnian burek.

69
00:03:29,499 --> 00:03:31,610
You know that Elizabeth
used an interpreter

70
00:03:31,634 --> 00:03:33,546
to contract a bounty hunter.

71
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,147
I found him in Sarajevo.

72
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:37,383
An effective chap of ill repute.

73
00:03:37,407 --> 00:03:40,219
Naturally, I assumed
the hunter's bounty was me.

74
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:42,221
Unfortunately, I was mistaken.

75
00:03:42,245 --> 00:03:44,924
How is not being a target unfortunate?

76
00:03:44,948 --> 00:03:47,226
It's unfortunate because
each time I think

77
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,162
Elizabeth won't go
to a darker place, she does.

78
00:03:50,186 --> 00:03:52,631
Elizabeth wanted the bounty
hunter to kill someone else?

79
00:03:52,655 --> 00:03:54,718
Not kill. Find.

80
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:56,835
Someone she wanted to work with.

81
00:03:56,859 --> 00:03:58,504
And why is that so dark?

82
00:03:58,528 --> 00:04:02,142
Because the person she's working
with brokers chemical weapons.

83
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:05,210
- I don't believe that.
- Her name is Mary Bremmer.

84
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:07,479
I'm not familiar with that name.

85
00:04:07,503 --> 00:04:08,814
Neither was I.

86
00:04:08,838 --> 00:04:11,350
The bounty hunter was
unable to locate her,

87
00:04:11,374 --> 00:04:13,552
but he put together
a dossier for Elizabeth.

88
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:16,088
- Dembe got a copy of it.
- Why would she do this?

89
00:04:16,112 --> 00:04:17,990
The same reason she worked to get

90
00:04:18,014 --> 00:04:19,992
The Freelancer released from prison.

91
00:04:20,016 --> 00:04:21,860
- You don't know that she did that.
- No.

92
00:04:21,884 --> 00:04:26,198
But I know her endgame...
To break me and then kill me.

93
00:04:26,222 --> 00:04:28,667
I think it's safe to assume
that she's using

94
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:31,915
The Freelancer and Chemical
Mary to accomplish that.

95
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,038
You think she's in business

96
00:04:33,062 --> 00:04:35,634
with a mass murderer and a war criminal?

97
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,068
As I said, it's all...
quite unfortunate.

98
00:04:42,372 --> 00:04:44,450
On the bright side,
I'm going to have a meeting

99
00:04:44,474 --> 00:04:47,086
with The Freelancer's
expensive new attorney.

100
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,655
Word on the street is that his client's

101
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:51,857
acquired identity papers, passports,

102
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:53,692
and that he's back to work.

103
00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:57,062
I want to know what he's doing.

104
00:04:57,086 --> 00:04:59,231
So we'll see what
his attorney has to say.

105
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,300
The dossier on Bremmer.

106
00:05:01,324 --> 00:05:04,236
It's incomplete, but it should
give you a head start.

107
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,589
Not a good time. I'm doing it now.

108
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:17,082
But this is it, Agent Keen.

109
00:05:17,106 --> 00:05:20,719
Once your target is eliminated,
you and I are even.

110
00:05:30,286 --> 00:05:32,264
I think what you're doing is wrong.

111
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:34,700
You're only making things worse
for Keen by pursuing her.

112
00:05:34,724 --> 00:05:37,136
Agent Park, you can rest assured...

113
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,438
I've heard it all before.

114
00:05:39,462 --> 00:05:42,741
It's a luxury to stand
on the moral high ground

115
00:05:42,765 --> 00:05:45,444
and critique those of us
on the low ground.

116
00:05:45,468 --> 00:05:48,331
A lot of people do exactly that.

117
00:05:49,118 --> 00:05:51,029
Until they need my help.

118
00:05:52,002 --> 00:05:54,520
I'll never ask for your help.

119
00:05:54,544 --> 00:05:57,723
Mr. Cooper called with
a heads-up. We have got a case.

120
00:05:57,747 --> 00:05:58,800
Okay.

121
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,127
Oh. Uh...

122
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:04,251
is that about your friend?

123
00:06:06,224 --> 00:06:07,521
I'm so sorry.

124
00:06:08,658 --> 00:06:09,978
Me too.

125
00:06:10,052 --> 00:06:12,764
It, uh... It sounded like
it might have been arson.

126
00:06:12,995 --> 00:06:14,573
Not "might." It was.

127
00:06:14,597 --> 00:06:15,774
Are there suspects?

128
00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:22,314
There was, but he disappeared.

129
00:06:22,338 --> 00:06:24,483
Have you talked to Mr. Reddington?

130
00:06:24,507 --> 00:06:26,618
I mean, he can find anyone,

131
00:06:26,642 --> 00:06:28,687
which, in this case,
it might help, right?

132
00:06:29,164 --> 00:06:30,689
I mean, if he found
the arsonist, you know,

133
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:34,359
justice, scales, balancing,
that kind of thing.

134
00:06:34,383 --> 00:06:36,662
But then on the downside,
you'd be in his debt,

135
00:06:36,686 --> 00:06:38,497
and, ohh,

136
00:06:38,521 --> 00:06:40,799
that is a record scratch
through your favorite song.

137
00:06:40,823 --> 00:06:42,803
I mean, can you even imagine?

138
00:06:43,326 --> 00:06:45,204
What was it you said earlier?

139
00:06:45,228 --> 00:06:47,439
That I'd never ask for your help.

140
00:06:47,463 --> 00:06:48,807
No, that couldn't be it.

141
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,895
I mean, the irony... It's crushing.

142
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:55,481
No. I can't imagine.

143
00:06:55,505 --> 00:06:58,450
Of course you can't because this is,
like, horrendous advice,

144
00:06:58,474 --> 00:07:01,653
which you are clearly
way too smart to take.

145
00:07:01,677 --> 00:07:03,088
Anyway...

146
00:07:03,112 --> 00:07:05,290
I'm really sorry about your friend.

147
00:07:12,388 --> 00:07:13,416
Will you help?

148
00:07:13,441 --> 00:07:16,969
You're asking me to make it all go away.

149
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,549
Say it.

150
00:07:21,489 --> 00:07:22,933
Make it go away.

151
00:07:23,065 --> 00:07:24,843
And if I do this, you're aware

152
00:07:24,867 --> 00:07:29,248
I may someday ask for a favor in return?

153
00:07:31,307 --> 00:07:35,754
You may come to wish you'd
accepted the consequences

154
00:07:35,778 --> 00:07:38,690
of your actions here instead.

155
00:07:41,585 --> 00:07:42,904
Are we good?

156
00:07:44,053 --> 00:07:46,031
He has a video of me on his phone.

157
00:07:46,055 --> 00:07:47,202
Ah, ah, ah!

158
00:07:47,226 --> 00:07:48,577
We'll take care of it.

159
00:07:49,058 --> 00:07:51,176
Like you were never here.

160
00:07:58,568 --> 00:08:00,579
Reddington refers to her
as Chemical Mary.

161
00:08:00,603 --> 00:08:02,314
This I.D. is more than 15 years old,

162
00:08:02,338 --> 00:08:04,049
but it's the most recent photo we have.

163
00:08:04,073 --> 00:08:05,617
What we know is this... Mary Bremmer

164
00:08:05,641 --> 00:08:08,687
is a former MIT professor
in pathobiological sciences

165
00:08:08,711 --> 00:08:11,456
who was fired for
ethical misconduct in '02.

166
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,358
Apparently she questioned
the appropriateness

167
00:08:13,382 --> 00:08:15,260
of a chemical-weapons ban,
reasoning that if

168
00:08:15,284 --> 00:08:17,529
nuclear weapons are an
acceptable deterrent to war,

169
00:08:17,553 --> 00:08:19,107
why not sarin gas?

170
00:08:19,135 --> 00:08:20,750
There's always a market
for that kind of crazy.

171
00:08:20,814 --> 00:08:22,901
I mean, I assume she's found
a way to monetize it.

172
00:08:22,925 --> 00:08:24,603
Yeah. The CIA thinks so.

173
00:08:24,627 --> 00:08:27,039
According to Langley,
Bremmer supplied the weaponry

174
00:08:27,063 --> 00:08:28,607
for the chlorine car-bomb massacre

175
00:08:28,631 --> 00:08:30,042
in the Abu Sayda market.

176
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:32,110
As for the assassination
of Kim Jong-nam,

177
00:08:32,134 --> 00:08:34,956
Bremmer's role, if any,
is still being investigated.

178
00:08:35,471 --> 00:08:37,149
I know. It doesn't seem possible.

179
00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:38,717
Well, because it's not possible.

180
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:40,886
Agent Keen would never work
with someone like this.

181
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,221
No, Agent Keen wouldn't.

182
00:08:42,245 --> 00:08:44,156
But she's not an agent anymore, is she?

183
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,824
Yeah, but you don't know her like we do.

184
00:08:45,848 --> 00:08:48,160
Maybe that's why I can see
what's really going on.

185
00:08:48,184 --> 00:08:50,420
What's going on is hard. On all of us.

186
00:08:51,128 --> 00:08:53,131
But the only way to find out
what's really happening

187
00:08:53,155 --> 00:08:54,366
is to find Agent Keen.

188
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,235
And right now finding Mary Bremmer

189
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:58,263
is our best hope of doing that.

190
00:08:58,295 --> 00:08:59,265
Okay.

191
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:03,942
Intel placed Bremmer
in the Idlib Province in 2013,

192
00:09:03,966 --> 00:09:06,278
supplying sarin to Assad forces.

193
00:09:06,302 --> 00:09:09,147
Now, a NATO operation
intercepted her convoy.

194
00:09:09,171 --> 00:09:11,049
Bremmer's vehicle was overturned
during the attack.

195
00:09:11,073 --> 00:09:12,551
Now, the shipment was stopped,

196
00:09:12,575 --> 00:09:15,420
but Bremmer escaped
and hasn't been seen since.

197
00:09:15,444 --> 00:09:17,556
Bremmer's entire security detail
was killed,

198
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,085
except for one man... Ismael Aknoz.

199
00:09:21,109 --> 00:09:22,961
At the time, Aknoz refused to give

200
00:09:22,985 --> 00:09:24,396
any information on Bremmer,

201
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,465
but after eight years of isolation

202
00:09:26,489 --> 00:09:30,702
in an F-Type prison in Ankara,
maybe he'll be ready to talk.

203
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,811
Ismael Aknoz? FBI.

204
00:09:39,835 --> 00:09:41,980
We'd like to talk to you
about Mary Bremmer.

205
00:09:51,747 --> 00:09:53,959
Well. This has been productive.

206
00:09:53,983 --> 00:09:55,460
We know you speak English.

207
00:09:55,484 --> 00:09:57,763
You want Bremmer. So do I.

208
00:09:57,787 --> 00:10:01,300
Nothing would give me more
happiness than to see her dead.

209
00:10:01,324 --> 00:10:02,634
Okay. Great. You help us find her,

210
00:10:02,658 --> 00:10:04,136
and we'd be happy to oblige you.

211
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,570
Why do you want to see her dead?

212
00:10:05,594 --> 00:10:07,372
What difference does it make?

213
00:10:07,396 --> 00:10:09,374
You were her partner. In her convoy.

214
00:10:09,398 --> 00:10:10,709
Why should we trust you?

215
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:12,711
It's her fault I'm here.

216
00:10:12,735 --> 00:10:15,714
Oh, so she forced you to
transport chemical weapons?

217
00:10:15,738 --> 00:10:17,916
We did not know
they were chemical weapons.

218
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,419
She told us we were moving
anti-tank missiles.

219
00:10:20,443 --> 00:10:23,575
So she lied to you, which is
why you're gonna help us.

220
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:25,616
Thank you. No.

221
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,651
I hate her, yes.

222
00:10:27,675 --> 00:10:29,070
But Americans?

223
00:10:30,077 --> 00:10:31,622
I hate you more.

224
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,857
We knew you spoke English
because our boss

225
00:10:33,881 --> 00:10:35,848
spoke with the Ministry of Justice.

226
00:10:35,872 --> 00:10:37,528
Now, you work with us, and they agreed

227
00:10:37,552 --> 00:10:39,163
to move you out of isolation.

228
00:10:39,187 --> 00:10:40,697
We're offering you a gift.

229
00:10:40,721 --> 00:10:43,867
No matter how much you hate us,
you should take it.

230
00:10:48,896 --> 00:10:50,407
Your allied forces...

231
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:52,743
They could have stopped us that day.

232
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:54,344
Arrested us, peacefully.

233
00:10:54,368 --> 00:10:58,115
Instead, they set up an ambush
with an IED

234
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:00,217
and started shooting.

235
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:01,885
Taking the weapons wasn't enough.

236
00:11:01,909 --> 00:11:04,588
They wanted to make an example of us.

237
00:11:04,612 --> 00:11:05,889
And to do that...

238
00:11:05,913 --> 00:11:08,525
they were willing to slaughter us.

239
00:11:10,751 --> 00:11:12,696
Take your "gift" and go.

240
00:11:30,297 --> 00:11:31,674
Who let you in here?!

241
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:35,044
Your assistant.
Lovely fellow. Not very savvy.

242
00:11:35,068 --> 00:11:38,014
Probably not best utilized
as the gatekeeper.

243
00:11:38,038 --> 00:11:41,884
Perhaps better suited
to make coffee, chit-chat.

244
00:11:41,908 --> 00:11:43,252
I know who you are.

245
00:11:43,276 --> 00:11:45,054
Tell me, when you go on a business trip,

246
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:48,124
do you charge by the hour
while you're on the plane?

247
00:11:48,148 --> 00:11:49,892
Or in the car to the hotel?

248
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,328
Or how about when you're enjoying

249
00:11:52,352 --> 00:11:54,731
the adult entertainment in your room?

250
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,433
Is your client paying $1,000 an hour

251
00:11:57,457 --> 00:12:00,770
for every hour or minute
that you masturbate?

252
00:12:00,794 --> 00:12:04,362
My goodness. And the world
thinks I'm a criminal.

253
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:06,815
What do you want?

254
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,220
For Dick the Butcher to have succeeded.

255
00:12:09,956 --> 00:12:12,801
"Henry IV, Part 2," Act IV, scene II.

256
00:12:12,826 --> 00:12:14,237
You've heard it.

257
00:12:14,262 --> 00:12:17,441
"The first thing we do,
let's kill all the lawyers."

258
00:12:17,577 --> 00:12:21,457
You seem like an appropriately
loathsome place to start.

259
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:24,627
Luckily for you, I want to know
where Alban Veseli is

260
00:12:24,651 --> 00:12:28,398
more than I want to sully
my hands or reputation

261
00:12:28,422 --> 00:12:32,635
by something so obvious
as disposing of you.

262
00:12:33,403 --> 00:12:34,937
I don't know where he is.

263
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:36,939
But you know how to contact him.

264
00:12:36,963 --> 00:12:39,075
If I do that, how do I know
you won't kill me?

265
00:12:39,099 --> 00:12:42,111
Because you still have a debt to repay.

266
00:12:42,135 --> 00:12:45,481
Elizabeth Keen paid you
to represent Veseli

267
00:12:45,505 --> 00:12:47,950
with money she stole from me.

268
00:12:47,974 --> 00:12:49,669
I want it back.

269
00:12:50,077 --> 00:12:52,255
You want me to give you back
my retainer.

270
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:55,124
Plus interest. There's the phone.

271
00:12:55,148 --> 00:12:58,027
Tell Alban his life
is in imminent danger,

272
00:12:58,051 --> 00:13:01,798
that you can't discuss it over
the phone, and set a meeting.

273
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,934
I think this qualifies as an emergency,

274
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,703
wouldn't you say, Scooter?

275
00:13:09,596 --> 00:13:11,340
Look, I know we're jet-lagged, so maybe

276
00:13:11,364 --> 00:13:13,710
we're not making ourselves
clear. Aknoz was a dead end.

277
00:13:13,734 --> 00:13:15,378
No, I know he didn't say anything.

278
00:13:15,402 --> 00:13:17,246
So what part of "dead end"
don't you understand?

279
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,648
He may not have said anything,

280
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,820
but I think he told you a lot.

281
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:23,152
- You have something?
- I've been studying the photos

282
00:13:23,176 --> 00:13:24,854
in the dossier that
Mr. Reddington gave us.

283
00:13:24,878 --> 00:13:27,423
The bodies in the lead Humvee
from the convoy...

284
00:13:27,447 --> 00:13:28,845
What do they all have in common?

285
00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:30,359
Other than being really dead.

286
00:13:30,383 --> 00:13:31,694
Well, they're all burned.

287
00:13:31,718 --> 00:13:33,196
You said Aknoz was, too.

288
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,498
That's what he told us.
He was disfigured.

289
00:13:35,522 --> 00:13:37,200
- Chemical burns?
- No.

290
00:13:37,224 --> 00:13:40,136
I think there may have been
an incendiary in the IED.

291
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,772
That Humvee burned like a bonfire.

292
00:13:42,796 --> 00:13:44,907
And Bremmer only escaped
after the explosion.

293
00:13:44,931 --> 00:13:46,209
If everyone else was burned,

294
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:48,111
it stands to reason that she was, too.

295
00:13:48,135 --> 00:13:50,913
If so, she couldn't have gotten
far without any medical help.

296
00:13:50,937 --> 00:13:52,982
Maybe burns like that
will lead to hypovolemic shock

297
00:13:53,006 --> 00:13:54,984
without timely medical intervention.

298
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:56,886
It is a life-threatening condition.

299
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,688
Any legitimate physician giving her aid

300
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,323
would have turned her over
to the authorities.

301
00:14:00,347 --> 00:14:02,492
So she found help
outside the established

302
00:14:02,516 --> 00:14:05,128
- medical community.
- Dirtbag doctors without borders.

303
00:14:05,152 --> 00:14:06,829
Sounds like a job for Reddington.

304
00:14:06,853 --> 00:14:08,564
Reach out to him, see if he has

305
00:14:08,588 --> 00:14:10,333
a medical contact who knows the area.

306
00:14:10,991 --> 00:14:12,702
Sir. The flash drive that you gave me?

307
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,237
I got it back from my friend at the NSA.

308
00:14:14,261 --> 00:14:15,838
Did he figure out the passcode?

309
00:14:15,862 --> 00:14:18,474
Please. He's not... He's not
that much smarter than me.

310
00:14:18,498 --> 00:14:20,810
I mean, sure he knows pi
out two more places,

311
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:22,812
but should one quinquadragintillion

312
00:14:22,836 --> 00:14:25,414
really determine who has to buy
the hot wings on bridge night?

313
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,650
- I don't think so.
- So he couldn't open it?

314
00:14:27,674 --> 00:14:29,452
Uh, sorry. Not technically, no.

315
00:14:29,476 --> 00:14:31,721
He couldn't read the data,
but he was able to use

316
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,724
a USB traffic sniffer
to see the operation commands

317
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:37,393
which bear the signature
of a known hacker.

318
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:39,328
She goes by the name of Rakitin.

319
00:14:39,352 --> 00:14:41,597
And when I say, uh, "she,"
I don't mean she's a woman.

320
00:14:41,621 --> 00:14:43,703
I mean, she could be. Or a man.

321
00:14:43,743 --> 00:14:45,101
I'm... I'm trying to
alternative pronouns

322
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,969
instead of defaulting
to the generic "he"

323
00:14:46,993 --> 00:14:49,071
to represent a man or a woman.

324
00:14:49,095 --> 00:14:51,874
Rakitin could be a he or a she.

325
00:14:51,898 --> 00:14:53,209
Or a they.

326
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:55,378
This is good. We know who the hacker is,

327
00:14:55,402 --> 00:14:57,680
but we still need to find out what he...

328
00:14:57,704 --> 00:14:59,248
Or she... hacked.

329
00:14:59,272 --> 00:15:01,617
And we won't know that
until you crack the passcode.

330
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:03,085
Right. I'm on it.

331
00:15:03,109 --> 00:15:05,188
Tell your NSA friend he did good work.

332
00:15:05,212 --> 00:15:08,474
- And buy hot wings for the month?
- Yeah... I don't think so.

333
00:15:09,235 --> 00:15:12,314
And they know to call us right away?

334
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:13,683
Yes. They do.

335
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:16,153
The minute The Freelancer
sets foot on U.S. soil,

336
00:15:16,178 --> 00:15:17,589
we'll know.

337
00:15:17,614 --> 00:15:19,058
Good morning!

338
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,761
Would you please tell Dr. Grundig

339
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,864
that Lloyd Wilke is here?

340
00:15:22,996 --> 00:15:24,540
Uh, do you have an appointment?

341
00:15:24,564 --> 00:15:27,160
Mine is a lifetime appointment.

342
00:15:31,238 --> 00:15:32,582
Ah!

343
00:15:32,606 --> 00:15:34,750
What a pleasant surprise.

344
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:37,987
Quite the environment
you've created here, Mickey.

345
00:15:38,011 --> 00:15:41,591
I can't tell if I'm in a waiting
room or a gentlemen's club.

346
00:15:41,615 --> 00:15:46,362
My mouth is positively watering
for a smokey single-malt

347
00:15:46,386 --> 00:15:49,298
and a smooth-draw Tatuaje Fausto.

348
00:15:49,322 --> 00:15:51,200
Well, a good first impression
is imperative

349
00:15:51,224 --> 00:15:54,437
to setting the tone for
a satisfied patient experience.

350
00:15:54,461 --> 00:15:56,572
Hah! My goodness. How far you've come.

351
00:15:56,596 --> 00:15:58,875
You know they used to call Mickey here

352
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:00,443
the Back-Room Butcher?

353
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:02,511
If there was a cash payment involved,

354
00:16:02,535 --> 00:16:04,513
he'd operate, no questions asked.

355
00:16:04,537 --> 00:16:06,949
Colleen, the break room could
use a fresh pot of coffee.

356
00:16:06,973 --> 00:16:08,284
You mind?

357
00:16:08,942 --> 00:16:11,153
There wasn't a medical
procedure in the book

358
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,224
you wouldn't perform...
Or at least try to.

359
00:16:14,249 --> 00:16:16,761
Of course that was after
they stripped your license.

360
00:16:16,786 --> 00:16:18,096
Cocaine, was it?

361
00:16:18,121 --> 00:16:20,300
But you kicked that and saved up enough

362
00:16:20,325 --> 00:16:23,804
to buy a brand-new identity
from me and look at you now!

363
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,835
Raymond. Please.
If any of this ever got out...

364
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,170
Well, it doesn't have to. Listen.

365
00:16:28,194 --> 00:16:30,773
I'm looking for a woman
named Mary Bremmer.

366
00:16:30,797 --> 00:16:33,175
Three years ago, she had a mishap

367
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,244
near the Syrian-Turkish border.

368
00:16:35,268 --> 00:16:38,481
Suffered terrible burns
requiring the kind of

369
00:16:38,505 --> 00:16:41,284
discrete medical care you once provided.

370
00:16:41,308 --> 00:16:42,752
I don't know her.

371
00:16:42,776 --> 00:16:45,187
But I suspect you may know
the sawbones who treated her.

372
00:16:45,211 --> 00:16:47,123
You want me to sell out another doctor?

373
00:16:47,147 --> 00:16:49,425
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

374
00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:51,961
the patient trades in chemical weapons.

375
00:16:51,985 --> 00:16:55,008
She's a scourge on the human race.

376
00:16:55,032 --> 00:16:58,434
Help me find her, and your past...

377
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,294
remains in the past.

378
00:17:03,997 --> 00:17:06,509
I require a demonstration
before I commit

379
00:17:06,533 --> 00:17:08,811
such significant resources.

380
00:17:08,835 --> 00:17:10,112
I hope you don't mind.

381
00:17:10,136 --> 00:17:12,715
Not at all. I expected as much.

382
00:17:12,739 --> 00:17:14,684
If, uh, one of your men

383
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:18,154
would retrieve the briefcase
in my trunk?

384
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,931
Bujare.

385
00:17:28,955 --> 00:17:30,366
What is wrong?

386
00:17:31,858 --> 00:17:34,170
You asked for a demonstration.

387
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:38,407
I'm giving you one.

388
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,734
Thanks to Mr. Reddington,
we got the identity

389
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:50,145
of the physician
who treated Mary Bremmer.

390
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,113
Yeah, but in Turkey.
It's gonna take us months

391
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,317
to obtain a search and seizure there.

392
00:17:53,341 --> 00:17:54,997
Given that his records may hold the key

393
00:17:55,021 --> 00:17:56,981
to our tracking a purveyor
of banned weapons,

394
00:17:57,016 --> 00:17:58,651
Main Justice authorized a shortcut

395
00:17:58,675 --> 00:18:00,486
by working with Turkish intelligence.

396
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,388
Hacking his medical records.

397
00:18:02,412 --> 00:18:04,757
So you were right.
She was burned in the Humvee.

398
00:18:04,781 --> 00:18:06,659
Badly enough to require
multiple skin grafts

399
00:18:06,683 --> 00:18:08,394
as well as personalized prosthetics.

400
00:18:08,418 --> 00:18:10,863
Now, these photos were taken
within a few days of the incident.

401
00:18:10,887 --> 00:18:13,766
But these... were taken a year later.

402
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,434
No wonder we couldn't find her.

403
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:18,137
We ran her current looks
through the Interpol database.

404
00:18:18,161 --> 00:18:19,438
What did it kick back?

405
00:18:19,462 --> 00:18:22,107
A single touch or an inhaled droplet

406
00:18:22,131 --> 00:18:23,842
disrupts the nerve signals

407
00:18:23,866 --> 00:18:27,513
to his muscles, his heart, and lungs.

408
00:18:27,537 --> 00:18:28,647
In a matter of seconds,

409
00:18:28,671 --> 00:18:31,417
breathing will not be option.

410
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:33,085
Six nationalities. Six aliases.

411
00:18:33,109 --> 00:18:36,088
All active, but according
to passport-control archives,

412
00:18:36,112 --> 00:18:38,591
the last one she used was yesterday.

413
00:18:38,615 --> 00:18:41,560
In Paris. Madeline Toussaint.

414
00:18:41,584 --> 00:18:44,496
Remarkable. The delivery system?

415
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,120
One drop on the key fob was all it took.

416
00:18:47,144 --> 00:18:49,234
Odorless, invisible.

417
00:18:49,258 --> 00:18:52,004
Lasts for days on any hard surface.

418
00:18:52,028 --> 00:18:55,140
Or load it into a crop duster
and take out a town.

419
00:18:55,164 --> 00:18:56,575
It's up to you.

420
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:58,243
Killing's never been easier.

421
00:18:58,267 --> 00:19:00,012
For the last nine months,

422
00:19:00,036 --> 00:19:02,114
Mary Bremmer's been living
as Madeline Toussaint

423
00:19:02,138 --> 00:19:04,183
in the Batignolles district of Paris.

424
00:19:04,207 --> 00:19:07,653
She has a cover job as a quality
engineer at a chemical plant.

425
00:19:07,677 --> 00:19:09,788
Contact Interpol.
Have them issue a Red Notice

426
00:19:09,812 --> 00:19:11,790
for Bremmer's conditional arrest
and extradition

427
00:19:11,814 --> 00:19:12,958
based on our charges.

428
00:19:12,982 --> 00:19:14,693
Then let's get a team to Paris.

429
00:19:14,717 --> 00:19:15,961
I'll go to Paris.

430
00:19:15,985 --> 00:19:17,696
I need your help with that passcode.

431
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,264
Well, I could look for it in Paris.

432
00:19:19,288 --> 00:19:21,834
You know, sidewalk café, pot of
coffee, couple'a croissants.

433
00:19:21,858 --> 00:19:24,670
I'm on my way to Capitol Hill
to ask about Rakitin.

434
00:19:24,694 --> 00:19:27,206
I doubt I'll get much traction
until you find out

435
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,568
what's on that drive.

436
00:19:29,866 --> 00:19:31,944
I guess that's a no
on that coffee and croissants.

437
00:19:31,968 --> 00:19:34,947
We'll say hi to Mona Lisa for you.

438
00:19:38,941 --> 00:19:40,986
Thank you for
taking the time, Congressman.

439
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,921
Always happy to make time for the FBI.

440
00:19:42,945 --> 00:19:44,957
Though I am surprised
there was no heads-up

441
00:19:44,981 --> 00:19:46,992
what you wanted to talk about.
Please, sit.

442
00:19:47,016 --> 00:19:50,029
Take a load off and tell me
what is so hush-hush

443
00:19:50,053 --> 00:19:52,965
I get an Assistant Director
to make a house call.

444
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:55,768
A hacker who goes by the name Rakitin.

445
00:19:55,792 --> 00:19:57,302
Never heard of him.

446
00:19:57,326 --> 00:19:58,904
- Excuse me?
- Anything else?

447
00:19:58,928 --> 00:20:01,106
Because I got a local Elks Club
waiting to take a photo.

448
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,842
Congressman. You chair
the House Intel Committee.

449
00:20:03,866 --> 00:20:06,912
I've read your report
on Russian cyber intrusion.

450
00:20:06,936 --> 00:20:08,774
I know you know who Rakitin is.

451
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:11,689
What I know is your title.

452
00:20:11,874 --> 00:20:15,381
What I don't know is what you do
because no one would tell me.

453
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:17,682
Yeah, I chair the Intel Committee,

454
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,302
but for some reason,
I can't get any intel on you.

455
00:20:20,327 --> 00:20:21,972
I run a classified task force.

456
00:20:21,997 --> 00:20:24,909
- That's interested in Rakitin.
- Why would that surprise you?

457
00:20:25,121 --> 00:20:27,032
I doesn't. It troubles me.

458
00:20:27,056 --> 00:20:29,234
Rakitin has friends in high places.

459
00:20:29,258 --> 00:20:31,297
I want to make sure
I'm not talking to one.

460
00:20:32,295 --> 00:20:35,107
I'm sorry. I'm...
I'm completely confused.

461
00:20:35,131 --> 00:20:37,643
Three weeks ago, the hard drive

462
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:40,112
on my committee's computer was hacked.

463
00:20:40,136 --> 00:20:42,147
All the intel we had on Rakitin
was destroyed.

464
00:20:42,171 --> 00:20:44,883
- I had no idea.
- My top staffer on the committee

465
00:20:44,907 --> 00:20:46,719
disappeared the day it happened.

466
00:20:46,743 --> 00:20:48,220
Vanished into thin air.

467
00:20:48,244 --> 00:20:51,356
And she was a patriot. A good person.

468
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,025
But someone got to her.

469
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:55,094
And if they got to her,
maybe they got to you.

470
00:20:55,118 --> 00:20:58,597
Maybe you're here to see
what I know about Rakitin,

471
00:20:58,621 --> 00:21:00,199
and if I know too much,

472
00:21:00,223 --> 00:21:02,367
maybe you're gonna want
to erase my hard drive.

473
00:21:02,391 --> 00:21:05,706
Here's a name and a number.
Call it. Ask about me.

474
00:21:06,329 --> 00:21:10,909
If you're satisfied with what
you hear, we can talk more.

475
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:13,912
If not, thank you for your time.

476
00:21:13,936 --> 00:21:16,248
I'm sure it seems like
I'm being overly paranoid.

477
00:21:16,272 --> 00:21:19,384
If we do talk, I'd like to
hear more about that hack.

478
00:21:19,408 --> 00:21:21,086
I have some paranoia of my own

479
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,622
about who might have been behind it.

480
00:21:23,646 --> 00:21:26,592
Rogelio. I hear you have news.

481
00:21:26,616 --> 00:21:29,394
A location... and a room number.

482
00:21:29,418 --> 00:21:30,996
Ah.

483
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,398
A youth hostel.

484
00:21:33,422 --> 00:21:35,434
How unexpectedly romantic.

485
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:38,137
Is there anywhere you
don't have eyes and ears?

486
00:21:38,161 --> 00:21:41,406
I got either a maid, a waiter,
a waitress, a busboy,

487
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,575
or a bellhop
in every corner of the city.

488
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:44,843
Thank you, my friend.

489
00:21:44,867 --> 00:21:47,346
And please give my regards to Carlos.

490
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:50,681
Unfortunately,
he's been deported... again.

491
00:21:50,716 --> 00:21:53,652
And your friend's tunnel
in Calexico has been shut down.

492
00:21:53,676 --> 00:21:56,388
Ah, the goings-on at the border.

493
00:21:56,412 --> 00:21:58,891
One side builds, the other shuts down.

494
00:21:58,915 --> 00:22:00,793
They hide, they seek,
they come, they go.

495
00:22:00,817 --> 00:22:03,529
It's all so... "Tom and Jerry."

496
00:22:03,553 --> 00:22:05,164
Yes, the tunnel is closed,

497
00:22:05,188 --> 00:22:07,099
but the submarine is fully operational.

498
00:22:07,123 --> 00:22:09,368
And for tracking down Alban Veseli,

499
00:22:09,392 --> 00:22:12,337
it will always be at your disposal.

500
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:22,815
I once had a brief dust-up
with an Armenian fellow

501
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:24,817
who took umbrage at my acquisition

502
00:22:24,841 --> 00:22:27,371
of a pipeline outside Kajaran.

503
00:22:27,844 --> 00:22:31,089
I tried to avoid him
by hiding out in a hostel.

504
00:22:31,113 --> 00:22:33,358
- You "tried." Did he find you?
- No.

505
00:22:33,382 --> 00:22:37,462
But after three days of communal
showers and curdled yogurt,

506
00:22:37,486 --> 00:22:40,465
James Taylor wannabes,
I couldn't stand it anymore.

507
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:42,935
So I stole a backpack
and a Fodor's Guide

508
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:45,871
and hiked to Turkey
through the Armenian Highlands.

509
00:22:45,895 --> 00:22:48,040
The Highlands. Mount Ararat.

510
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,475
Yes. And FYI... no Ark.

511
00:22:53,302 --> 00:22:55,781
Ah. Some things never change.

512
00:22:59,508 --> 00:23:03,322
No cameras. No security.
Smart place to lay low.

513
00:23:15,133 --> 00:23:17,057
Not here.

514
00:23:19,595 --> 00:23:22,341
Ah!

515
00:23:22,365 --> 00:23:24,877
Running in a towel never ends well.

516
00:23:24,901 --> 00:23:28,168
Put some pants on, and let's talk.

517
00:23:31,651 --> 00:23:33,852
I did as you suggested, Mr. Cooper.

518
00:23:33,877 --> 00:23:35,799
Checked up on
you with Cynthia Panabaker.

519
00:23:35,823 --> 00:23:38,135
A straight arrow if ever there was one.

520
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,903
- She likes you.
- Does she, now?

521
00:23:39,927 --> 00:23:42,039
Well, she said,
"He won't pee on your leg

522
00:23:42,063 --> 00:23:43,674
and tell you it's rainin'."

523
00:23:43,698 --> 00:23:45,709
Sounds like Cynthia.

524
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,844
You said before that you were looking

525
00:23:47,868 --> 00:23:50,180
for information about Rakitin.

526
00:23:50,204 --> 00:23:52,649
I'm curious what your committee
knows about him.

527
00:23:52,673 --> 00:23:54,451
Not a hell of a lot, to be honest.

528
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:55,820
We don't have an I.D.

529
00:23:55,844 --> 00:23:59,022
Hell, Rakitin could be an entire
hacker group for all we know.

530
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:01,792
But he's using a series
of servers in Volgograd,

531
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:04,861
and he is targeting some of our
most carefully guarded secrets.

532
00:24:04,885 --> 00:24:07,450
- Such as...?
- The identities

533
00:24:07,517 --> 00:24:09,800
of CIA assets in Yasenevo...

534
00:24:10,024 --> 00:24:11,266
their funding sources,

535
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:13,637
hacks of our own internal
threat assessments.

536
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,338
What does he do with this intel?

537
00:24:15,362 --> 00:24:16,873
There are a lot of theories.

538
00:24:16,897 --> 00:24:19,309
NSA thinks he's
a black-market profiteer.

539
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,378
CIA's convinced he's a turncoat.

540
00:24:21,402 --> 00:24:22,820
And what do you think?

541
00:24:24,138 --> 00:24:26,817
Have you ever heard of N-13?

542
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:28,318
Sleeper agent.

543
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:30,387
A Russian asset who vanished
during the Cold War

544
00:24:30,411 --> 00:24:32,122
and was never proven to exist.

545
00:24:32,146 --> 00:24:34,090
It's a 30-year-old ghost story.

546
00:24:34,582 --> 00:24:36,582
What if it's not?

547
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:41,198
What if that asset is here?

548
00:24:41,222 --> 00:24:43,900
Not only active and deeply embedded,

549
00:24:43,924 --> 00:24:47,304
but maneuvering
within our intel community?

550
00:24:47,328 --> 00:24:49,472
I don't know whose trust
he might have gained...

551
00:24:49,496 --> 00:24:52,776
CIA, Defense Intelligence...
God forbid, the FBI.

552
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,147
But I think he's been here a long time.

553
00:24:57,171 --> 00:24:59,516
Long enough, he's become one of us.

554
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,184
And he's using us.

555
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:04,154
You think Rakitin's feeding
active intel to N-13.

556
00:25:04,178 --> 00:25:05,555
I do.

557
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:07,023
I think I'm the only man on this hill

558
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:10,637
who may believe your ghost story
about a Russian spy.

559
00:25:10,661 --> 00:25:12,128
Go on.

560
00:25:12,152 --> 00:25:14,264
We've recently intercepted a thumb drive

561
00:25:14,288 --> 00:25:17,534
containing sensitive intel we
believe was obtained by Rakitin.

562
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:20,303
I suspect he intended to
deliver that drive to N-13.

563
00:25:20,327 --> 00:25:21,771
Why do you say that?

564
00:25:21,795 --> 00:25:25,141
Did anything on the drive identify N-13?

565
00:25:25,165 --> 00:25:27,577
All I can say is our source
believes it was intended

566
00:25:27,601 --> 00:25:29,646
for someone on our Most Wanted List.

567
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:32,349
Well, whoever your source is,
he or she is way off base.

568
00:25:32,373 --> 00:25:34,484
I'm telling you... N-13 is buried

569
00:25:34,508 --> 00:25:36,753
deep within the U.S. government.

570
00:25:36,777 --> 00:25:40,156
That said, I strongly encourage
you to follow up on it.

571
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,192
Based on what I know of Rakitin,

572
00:25:42,216 --> 00:25:46,429
he and N-13 pose an imminent
threat to national security.

573
00:25:49,723 --> 00:25:53,303
I must admit I'm surprised
you took this contract, Alban.

574
00:25:53,327 --> 00:25:55,639
I'd never pretend to call us friends,

575
00:25:55,663 --> 00:25:57,807
but we are professional associates.

576
00:25:57,831 --> 00:25:59,376
It's a job.

577
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,245
Unbridled resentment. Is that
what this is all about?

578
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,848
You somehow blame me
for you going to prison.

579
00:26:04,872 --> 00:26:07,417
- You are why I went to prison.
- No.

580
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:10,253
You went to prison because
you were caught doing a job

581
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,855
I hired you to do.

582
00:26:11,879 --> 00:26:14,457
Don't blame me for your
failed cut-and-run.

583
00:26:14,481 --> 00:26:17,027
I've been in that box for seven years.

584
00:26:17,051 --> 00:26:20,297
And now you're out.
Because of Elizabeth Keen.

585
00:26:20,321 --> 00:26:22,699
That is why you're aligned
with her, isn't it?

586
00:26:22,723 --> 00:26:24,801
You bear me resentment for your failure,

587
00:26:24,825 --> 00:26:26,770
and now you both want me dead?

588
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:28,605
What's he so worked up about?

589
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:32,609
Talk to me about Agent Keen.
Tell me where I can find her.

590
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:33,877
No idea.

591
00:26:33,901 --> 00:26:35,979
Raymond.

592
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:45,088
You just flew in from Paris.
What were you doing there?

593
00:26:45,112 --> 00:26:47,524
Taking a tour of the Temple de I'Amour?

594
00:26:47,548 --> 00:26:49,993
Strolling along the Canal Saint-Martin?

595
00:26:50,017 --> 00:26:53,430
What do you think?
I was setting up the job.

596
00:26:53,454 --> 00:26:56,466
- I have no plans to be in France.
- So?

597
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,269
So how were you going to
carry out your contract?

598
00:26:59,293 --> 00:27:02,105
What's wrong with him?
How were you going to kill me?

599
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:05,831
The contract's not on you.

600
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,902
Who were you hired to kill?

601
00:27:11,638 --> 00:27:13,016
Madeline Toussaint.

602
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,251
At least that's the name
she's using right now.

603
00:27:15,275 --> 00:27:17,220
This is the address
she gave her current employer.

604
00:27:17,244 --> 00:27:19,856
If she's here, we're gonna have
to make the provisional arrest.

605
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,558
You can file for extradition afterward.

606
00:27:21,582 --> 00:27:23,827
We're just here for backup.

607
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,182
_

608
00:27:35,206 --> 00:27:36,375
_

609
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,399
_

610
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:40,424
_

611
00:27:40,449 --> 00:27:41,470
_

612
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:45,080
_

613
00:27:45,535 --> 00:27:47,535
_

614
00:27:49,749 --> 00:27:51,749
_

615
00:27:51,786 --> 00:27:53,556
_

616
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,717
Where is she?

617
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:58,748
_

618
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:02,087
She's visiting an aunt in
Albania. She'll be back later today.

619
00:28:02,136 --> 00:28:04,136
_

620
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:08,349
_

621
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:10,407
Gun!

622
00:28:14,501 --> 00:28:16,346
Hang on. We'll get help.

623
00:28:20,607 --> 00:28:22,434
She's dead.

624
00:28:22,876 --> 00:28:25,188
You know how much I love
I told you so, Harold,

625
00:28:25,212 --> 00:28:27,857
so I confirmed the fact
straight from the source.

626
00:28:27,881 --> 00:28:29,559
Elizabeth sprung The Freelancer

627
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:30,994
so she could engage his services.

628
00:28:31,018 --> 00:28:32,695
I refuse to believe that.

629
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:34,964
Alban Veseli cloaks
assassination in mass murder.

630
00:28:34,988 --> 00:28:36,766
I don't care how far she's slipped,

631
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,002
Agent Keen would never use
The Freelancer to kill you.

632
00:28:39,026 --> 00:28:41,438
You're half-right. She didn't
hire him to kill me.

633
00:28:41,462 --> 00:28:44,164
She hired him to kill Chemical Mary.

634
00:28:44,565 --> 00:28:46,643
- Mary Bremmer. Why?
- I'm not sure.

635
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:48,978
I'm hoping a slightly more creative

636
00:28:49,002 --> 00:28:52,749
line of questioning will
persuade him to reveal his plan.

637
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:56,453
But one thing is clear...
It's already in motion.

638
00:28:56,477 --> 00:28:59,122
Ressler's at Bremmer's
residence in Paris now.

639
00:28:59,146 --> 00:29:01,357
She's apparently flying back
from Albania today.

640
00:29:01,381 --> 00:29:04,194
A transcontinental flight
filled with innocent passengers?

641
00:29:04,218 --> 00:29:05,962
We're contacting the airlines now.

642
00:29:05,986 --> 00:29:08,186
_

643
00:29:08,703 --> 00:29:10,703
_

644
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,877
_

645
00:29:16,236 --> 00:29:17,507
_

646
00:29:17,531 --> 00:29:19,175
Merci!

647
00:29:19,199 --> 00:29:20,810
Move swiftly, Harold.

648
00:29:20,834 --> 00:29:22,779
If Mary Bremmer boards that plane...

649
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:24,781
I'll bet you nickels to navy beans

650
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:27,624
the only way it comes down is in pieces.

651
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:32,602
We got a hit on one
of Bremmer's passports.

652
00:29:32,627 --> 00:29:35,148
She's currently en route
to France on Parisian Air.

653
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:36,729
Okay. We're 10 minutes
from Charles de Gaulle.

654
00:29:36,753 --> 00:29:38,864
- How long before she lands?
- About a half an hour,

655
00:29:38,888 --> 00:29:41,274
but we have to assume
that plane won't land.

656
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:44,411
There are 162 passengers
on board, including families.

657
00:29:44,435 --> 00:29:45,640
And he'll kill everyone.

658
00:29:45,676 --> 00:29:47,748
Wait. I thought The Freelancer
was going after Reddington.

659
00:29:47,772 --> 00:29:49,082
That's what we all thought.

660
00:29:49,106 --> 00:29:50,384
Alright. The airline's
confirming that Bremmer's

661
00:29:50,408 --> 00:29:51,985
on the boarded-passenger manifest.

662
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:53,987
So Keen's taking out
a chemical arms trader...

663
00:29:54,011 --> 00:29:55,923
Air hugs for that...
But she's gonna waste a plane

664
00:29:55,947 --> 00:29:57,591
full of passengers in the process?

665
00:29:57,615 --> 00:30:00,093
Have the airport authority
prepare for contingencies...

666
00:30:00,117 --> 00:30:02,191
Rescue units, medics.
You know the routine.

667
00:30:02,215 --> 00:30:03,900
Okay. Thank you. Uh, I've got the tower.

668
00:30:03,924 --> 00:30:05,399
I've got air-traffic control
on the line.

669
00:30:05,423 --> 00:30:06,934
Call me when you're on site.

670
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:08,335
Copy that.

671
00:30:08,678 --> 00:30:10,055
Hello. This is Harold Cooper.

672
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,924
I'm the Assistant Director of the FBI

673
00:30:11,948 --> 00:30:13,893
calling from Washington, D.C.

674
00:30:13,917 --> 00:30:16,394
Stephan Gervais. ATC Supervisor.
What's going on?

675
00:30:16,418 --> 00:30:17,991
We have a credible threat
that someone's trying

676
00:30:18,031 --> 00:30:20,666
to bring down Parisian Air flight 2419.

677
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:23,435
- Really? How?
- Well, we don't know that yet, Stephan.

678
00:30:23,459 --> 00:30:25,154
We need your help figuring it out.

679
00:30:25,178 --> 00:30:27,090
Parisian Air 2-4-1 niner.

680
00:30:27,114 --> 00:30:28,524
Are you currently experiencing

681
00:30:28,548 --> 00:30:31,327
any problems or equipment malfunctions?

682
00:30:31,351 --> 00:30:34,597
Negative, Tower. Everything is
showing normal at this time.

683
00:30:34,621 --> 00:30:37,366
Anything unusual show up
in your preflight checklist?

684
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:39,168
Nothing. May I ask why?

685
00:30:39,192 --> 00:30:41,704
Switch to discrete frequency 133.6.

686
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,474
What do you want me to tell them?

687
00:30:44,498 --> 00:30:46,042
Should they be looking for a bomb?

688
00:30:46,066 --> 00:30:47,477
Suspect engages

689
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:49,445
in terrorist activities
disguised as accidents.

690
00:30:49,469 --> 00:30:50,780
It's doubtful he'd use explosives.

691
00:30:50,804 --> 00:30:52,615
Okay, he was physically on that plane.

692
00:30:52,639 --> 00:30:54,617
Airport security has footage
of him entering the cabin

693
00:30:54,641 --> 00:30:56,285
along with the cleaning crew.

694
00:30:56,309 --> 00:30:57,687
Tower, is there anything

695
00:30:57,711 --> 00:30:59,455
we should be worried about up here?

696
00:30:59,479 --> 00:31:01,124
We've just begun our descent.

697
00:31:01,148 --> 00:31:02,558
Stand by. One moment.

698
00:31:02,582 --> 00:31:04,127
They just started their descent.

699
00:31:04,151 --> 00:31:06,785
- The instrument panel.
- What about it?

700
00:31:07,921 --> 00:31:10,600
Seven years ago, Veseli
derailed a passenger trail

701
00:31:10,624 --> 00:31:13,803
by making it hit a curve too fast.

702
00:31:18,965 --> 00:31:21,366
Clear! Clear out!

703
00:31:23,156 --> 00:31:26,516
He did that by rigging
the two speed-data sources

704
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,551
in the control cabin
to show the train traveling

705
00:31:28,575 --> 00:31:30,953
at a slower speed than its actual rate.

706
00:31:30,977 --> 00:31:33,823
Can your pilots check their
controls for signs of tampering?

707
00:31:33,847 --> 00:31:36,058
Parisian Air 2-4-1 niner, it's possible

708
00:31:36,082 --> 00:31:38,661
your flight controls have been
physically compromised.

709
00:31:38,685 --> 00:31:40,830
Can you take a careful look around?

710
00:31:40,854 --> 00:31:42,865
Roger. Stand by, Tower.

711
00:31:57,871 --> 00:31:59,849
- There is a thumb drive here.
- We got something.

712
00:31:59,873 --> 00:32:03,152
Someone left a thumb drive
inside the Data Loader.

713
00:32:03,176 --> 00:32:04,854
There's a panel inside the cockpit

714
00:32:04,878 --> 00:32:06,722
for software and database updates.

715
00:32:06,746 --> 00:32:08,357
Someone left a thumb drive inside.

716
00:32:08,381 --> 00:32:10,226
Which could be corrupting
their instruments

717
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,028
or running its own scripts.

718
00:32:12,052 --> 00:32:13,596
Oh, no.

719
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,631
You said the plane's
making its approach.

720
00:32:15,655 --> 00:32:17,867
Are your tracking systems
showing anything unusual?

721
00:32:17,891 --> 00:32:20,136
Our GPS system is based
entirely on information

722
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,871
transmitted to us from the aircraft.

723
00:32:21,895 --> 00:32:23,806
If that plane isn't where
it should be right now,

724
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,374
we would not know it from down here.

725
00:32:25,398 --> 00:32:27,210
Okay, that data stick
wasn't left there by accident.

726
00:32:27,234 --> 00:32:30,847
It is a brute-force attack.
Take it out! Take it out now!

727
00:32:30,871 --> 00:32:32,215
Parisian Air 2-4-1 niner.

728
00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:34,050
Remove the drive from the Data Loader.

729
00:32:34,074 --> 00:32:35,585
I repeat! Remove the drive!

730
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:38,554
Copy, Tower.

731
00:32:39,713 --> 00:32:41,591
Warning.

732
00:32:41,615 --> 00:32:42,825
Warning.

733
00:32:46,453 --> 00:32:48,331
- Warning.
- Autopilot off!

734
00:32:48,355 --> 00:32:50,566
Flight directors off.

735
00:33:02,369 --> 00:33:03,779
What's going on?

736
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:06,415
They're too low. Immediate right turn!

737
00:33:06,439 --> 00:33:08,084
Heading 2-3-zero!

738
00:33:08,108 --> 00:33:10,319
Traffic is directly in front of you!

739
00:33:10,343 --> 00:33:11,921
I have control!

740
00:33:26,793 --> 00:33:28,938
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm terribly sorry

741
00:33:28,962 --> 00:33:31,240
for that sudden shift in altitude.

742
00:33:31,264 --> 00:33:32,942
We obviously had an incident,

743
00:33:32,966 --> 00:33:36,212
but we are safe and on course
and will be landing shortly.

744
00:33:45,512 --> 00:33:48,224
- What's happening?!
- Uh, are... are they dying?

745
00:33:48,248 --> 00:33:49,659
No, sir.

746
00:33:49,683 --> 00:33:51,861
I believe those are
cries of celebration.

747
00:33:51,885 --> 00:33:55,865
Tower. Parisian Air 2-4-1 niner.

748
00:33:55,889 --> 00:33:58,901
We are clear of the traffic
and climbing to 8,000.

749
00:33:58,925 --> 00:34:02,238
We will be begin
our approach for landing.

750
00:34:19,846 --> 00:34:22,725
Excuse me. A passenger. Mary Bremmer?

751
00:34:22,749 --> 00:34:24,393
Oh, that's it. That's everyone.

752
00:34:24,417 --> 00:34:26,362
- Are you sure?
- Feel free to take a look,

753
00:34:26,386 --> 00:34:28,497
but I checked the cabins personally.

754
00:34:28,521 --> 00:34:30,421
There's no one left on the plane.

755
00:34:34,504 --> 00:34:36,487
Mary Bremmer was not ever on that plane.

756
00:34:36,511 --> 00:34:38,045
She made it to the airport,

757
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,326
but she was abducted
outside the terminal.

758
00:34:42,193 --> 00:34:44,238
What about the passenger manifest?

759
00:34:44,262 --> 00:34:46,140
You said it showed her on board.

760
00:34:46,568 --> 00:34:48,009
Shortly after Bremmer was taken,

761
00:34:48,033 --> 00:34:50,244
an unidentified woman
entered the terminal

762
00:34:50,268 --> 00:34:53,114
with her passport and ticket,
which was slipped into the purse

763
00:34:53,138 --> 00:34:55,649
of an unsuspecting passenger
at the gate.

764
00:34:55,673 --> 00:34:57,853
The unidentified woman
then left the terminal,

765
00:34:57,877 --> 00:35:00,577
and the passenger boarded
the flight as Bremmer.

766
00:35:02,314 --> 00:35:05,494
This "unidentified woman."
She look familiar to you?

767
00:35:05,921 --> 00:35:09,231
These are the best images
we could pull, but, yes...

768
00:35:09,255 --> 00:35:11,066
we believe it's Keen.

769
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:15,570
So, Elizabeth conducted
an operatic performance,

770
00:35:15,594 --> 00:35:17,973
getting an assassin out of prison,

771
00:35:17,997 --> 00:35:21,309
elaborately sabotaging
a commercial airliner,

772
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:24,346
only to snatch her target
from the jaws of death

773
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,581
at the last second?

774
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,950
Perhaps she wanted the world to believe

775
00:35:28,974 --> 00:35:30,852
Bremmer died in that crash.

776
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,022
To what end?

777
00:35:34,282 --> 00:35:36,024
I can't fathom.

778
00:35:36,451 --> 00:35:38,293
It's more likely Elizabeth wanted

779
00:35:38,317 --> 00:35:40,595
Bremmer to think she saved her life,

780
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:42,864
which would put Bremmer
in Elizabeth's debt.

781
00:35:42,888 --> 00:35:44,199
Whatever they're working on,

782
00:35:44,223 --> 00:35:46,535
we're gonna make it
as difficult as possible.

783
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:49,604
Our people are combing through
Bremmer's flat in Paris

784
00:35:49,628 --> 00:35:51,740
and have ID'd a number of associates.

785
00:35:51,764 --> 00:35:53,375
Teams are en route as we speak.

786
00:35:54,667 --> 00:35:56,745
I still can't get over
the fact that Elizabeth

787
00:35:56,769 --> 00:35:59,581
was willing to let
The Freelancer crash two planes.

788
00:36:01,941 --> 00:36:04,052
I was holding out hope for her.
We all were.

789
00:36:04,076 --> 00:36:09,291
But now? It seems she's past
the point of no return.

790
00:36:09,315 --> 00:36:11,426
- FBI!
- Turn around!

791
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,761
Give me your hands!

792
00:36:14,854 --> 00:36:17,833
I'll try to leave the
moralizing to you, Harold.

793
00:36:20,392 --> 00:36:24,294
In the meantime, perhaps
this will ease your pain.

794
00:36:25,164 --> 00:36:28,643
Tell Donald to pay a visit
to this address.

795
00:36:28,667 --> 00:36:30,112
What is this?

796
00:36:30,136 --> 00:36:31,880
Your team worked very hard to put

797
00:36:31,904 --> 00:36:35,385
The Freelancer behind bars
the first time around.

798
00:36:35,808 --> 00:36:38,687
I think that's probably
the right place for him.

799
00:36:45,784 --> 00:36:47,397
Thank you for the Scotch.

800
00:37:03,936 --> 00:37:06,047
Whoa, whoa. Easy, brah.

801
00:37:06,071 --> 00:37:08,877
The man in the hat
said the popo would be here.

802
00:37:14,215 --> 00:37:16,191
Why does this feel like
an empty victory?

803
00:37:16,215 --> 00:37:17,692
Because this guy has no idea

804
00:37:17,716 --> 00:37:19,846
what Keen's up to with Chemical Mary.

805
00:37:20,653 --> 00:37:22,964
Open this door right now!

806
00:37:22,988 --> 00:37:24,733
I want to see her!

807
00:37:24,757 --> 00:37:28,236
Where is she?! The woman!

808
00:37:28,521 --> 00:37:30,672
I want to talk to her!

809
00:37:30,696 --> 00:37:32,407
Do you hear me?!

810
00:37:32,431 --> 00:37:33,693
Ugh!

811
00:37:34,633 --> 00:37:38,547
Open this door right now!
I want to see her!

812
00:37:43,309 --> 00:37:45,754
Angela is the one you were asking about.

813
00:37:45,778 --> 00:37:48,924
She's the one who told me
that Veseli was at the hostel.

814
00:37:48,948 --> 00:37:51,493
Angela, I can't thank you enough.

815
00:37:51,517 --> 00:37:53,094
I just have one question.

816
00:37:53,118 --> 00:37:57,566
I need to know how you came
by this valuable information.

817
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:01,519
_

818
00:38:01,606 --> 00:38:03,084
It was...

819
00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:05,440
a woman.

820
00:38:05,464 --> 00:38:07,409
This woman?

821
00:38:07,433 --> 00:38:09,211
Ah.

822
00:38:09,235 --> 00:38:11,346
I, uh, asked her

823
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:14,382
how she know that I was looking for him.

824
00:38:14,406 --> 00:38:16,117
She wouldn't say.

825
00:38:16,141 --> 00:38:17,362
Gracias.

826
00:38:20,179 --> 00:38:22,023
Oh, and your cousin Carlos.

827
00:38:22,047 --> 00:38:25,460
I'm told he's somewhere under
the Gulf of Mexico as we speak.

828
00:38:25,484 --> 00:38:27,229
Muchas gracias, Raymond.

829
00:38:27,253 --> 00:38:28,730
If there's anything I can do for you...

830
00:38:28,754 --> 00:38:31,666
You've done more than you know.
And all to the good.

831
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,132
Well, that's a load off.

832
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:40,308
Elizabeth wanted you
to find The Freelancer.

833
00:38:40,332 --> 00:38:41,443
Yeah.

834
00:38:41,467 --> 00:38:44,079
Knowing that when we did,
we'd work with the FBI

835
00:38:44,103 --> 00:38:46,381
to stop him from crashing that plane.

836
00:38:46,405 --> 00:38:49,985
So she hires a lawyer
to obtain Veseli's freedom,

837
00:38:50,009 --> 00:38:52,153
pays Veseli to crash a plane,

838
00:38:52,177 --> 00:38:55,690
uses the threat of that crash
to gain Chemical Mary's trust,

839
00:38:55,714 --> 00:38:58,760
gives us intel to keep
the plane from going down.

840
00:38:58,784 --> 00:39:00,695
Sounds like one of your plans.

841
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:01,997
It doesn't, doesn't it?

842
00:39:02,021 --> 00:39:04,833
She may not be interested
in crash a plane,

843
00:39:04,857 --> 00:39:07,302
but she's still in business
with a war criminal.

844
00:39:07,326 --> 00:39:08,770
Tomorrow's problem.

845
00:39:08,794 --> 00:39:10,839
Tonight, we savor the small victory.

846
00:39:10,863 --> 00:39:13,808
And we should tell Edward
to fuel the jet.

847
00:39:13,832 --> 00:39:16,978
We need to pay our friend
in Moscow a visit.

848
00:39:20,739 --> 00:39:23,084
Uh, hi. Um, sir, uh, sorry to...

849
00:39:23,108 --> 00:39:26,488
It's, uh, late, and, uh,
you're drinking... alone...

850
00:39:26,512 --> 00:39:28,790
Uh, which is... which is, fine.
I mean, I can...

851
00:39:28,814 --> 00:39:30,225
What is it?

852
00:39:30,249 --> 00:39:32,694
- Good news on the passcode.
- You cracked it.

853
00:39:32,718 --> 00:39:34,247
What? Oh, uh, no.

854
00:39:34,426 --> 00:39:36,665
Uh, that would be great news,
like miraculously great.

855
00:39:36,689 --> 00:39:39,736
No. Uh, the good news is
I figured out how to crack it.

856
00:39:40,492 --> 00:39:41,525
With this.

857
00:39:41,906 --> 00:39:44,039
I don't think Rakitin chose
a steel flash drive

858
00:39:44,063 --> 00:39:45,407
to protect his software.

859
00:39:45,431 --> 00:39:47,242
If I'm right, there's
a capacitive scanner

860
00:39:47,266 --> 00:39:48,877
hidden in the flash drive.

861
00:39:48,901 --> 00:39:51,913
It is the best security platform
in passwordless identification.

862
00:39:51,937 --> 00:39:53,148
So there's no password.

863
00:39:53,172 --> 00:39:56,252
It's biometric. And that
is where this comes in.

864
00:39:56,842 --> 00:39:58,720
Get the print, put it in, and...

865
00:39:58,744 --> 00:40:00,588
...open sesame.

866
00:40:00,612 --> 00:40:02,123
Or, um, you know, some less

867
00:40:02,147 --> 00:40:04,225
politically incorrect exclamation.

868
00:40:04,249 --> 00:40:06,861
- So all I need is a fingerprint.
- Yeah.

869
00:40:06,885 --> 00:40:09,015
And that is where the miracle comes in.

870
00:40:09,455 --> 00:40:11,184
Figuring out whose print to use.

871
00:40:12,691 --> 00:40:14,569
Thank you, Aram.

872
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:16,738
Here's hoping for a miracle.

873
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:37,192
Raymond!

874
00:40:37,216 --> 00:40:39,716
_

875
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,397

877
00:40:52,965 --> 00:40:57,178
Thank you for coming.
We have much to discuss.

878
00:40:57,202 --> 00:40:59,981
I am told Rakitin is in play.

879
00:41:00,005 --> 00:41:02,417
My safe deposit box was compromised.

880
00:41:03,444 --> 00:41:05,887
The flash drive I entrusted you with?

881
00:41:05,911 --> 00:41:07,222
I'm still looking for it.

882
00:41:07,246 --> 00:41:09,491
No doubt we have Elizabeth Keen to thank

883
00:41:09,515 --> 00:41:11,327
for it going missing.

884
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:14,763
My position in regard to her
has not changed.

885
00:41:14,787 --> 00:41:17,625
I understand. She is untouchable.

886
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,087
But you must understand...

887
00:41:20,192 --> 00:41:22,904
Harold Cooper is not.

888
00:41:32,571 --> 00:41:34,783
Will miracles never cease?

889
00:41:34,807 --> 00:41:38,586
If he gains access to the Rakitin files,

890
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:41,024
you'll have to eliminate him.

891
00:41:43,582 --> 00:41:45,445
I understand.
