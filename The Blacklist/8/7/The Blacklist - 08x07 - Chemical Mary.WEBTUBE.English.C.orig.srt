1
00:00:04,913 --> 00:00:06,706
Previously on "The Blacklist"...

2
00:00:06,816 --> 00:00:09,186
I'm not an errand boy.
I won't be ordered about.

3
00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:12,084
We'd like you to make this go away.

4
00:00:12,123 --> 00:00:14,807
We know about Keen. What she's saying.

5
00:00:14,831 --> 00:00:16,342
That you're N-13.

6
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:18,310
Elizabeth's gone, and she's taken

7
00:00:18,334 --> 00:00:19,845
something of mine with her.

8
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:22,114
I suppose you also
think that she's responsible

9
00:00:22,138 --> 00:00:23,349
for The Freelancer's release.

10
00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:25,184
There's always more to the story.

11
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:26,986
- Where is he?
- The work of a man

12
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,354
who disguises his killings

13
00:00:28,378 --> 00:00:30,523
in the headlines of everyday tragedies.

14
00:00:30,547 --> 00:00:33,759
The arrest that you
made earlier. Mason Dieterle.

15
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,561
He burned down
my friend's restaurant.

16
00:00:35,585 --> 00:00:38,597
I just got off the phone with
the AUSA reviewing the case.

17
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:41,300
He told me that your friend
passed away from her injuries.

18
00:00:41,324 --> 00:00:42,801
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:44,970
You promised me you wouldn't
do anything to Dieterle.

20
00:00:44,994 --> 00:00:48,007
I need to know...
Did you break that promise?

21
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,319
No, sir.

22
00:00:54,771 --> 00:00:56,248
We've been formulating

23
00:00:56,272 --> 00:00:57,977
those binary structures
you gave us for weeks

24
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:00,643
and... I think we've done it.

25
00:01:00,711 --> 00:01:03,556
We identified the exact
structure of the Novichok agent.

26
00:01:05,615 --> 00:01:09,161
Pig, hog, runt...

27
00:01:09,185 --> 00:01:11,397
sow...

28
00:01:11,421 --> 00:01:12,881
boar.

29
00:01:13,523 --> 00:01:15,749
My brother's mantra.

30
00:01:15,773 --> 00:01:18,285
When he was a boy,
he collected glass pigs.

31
00:01:18,309 --> 00:01:21,181
He knew everything
there was to know about them.

32
00:01:21,646 --> 00:01:23,390
Which side-group is this?

33
00:01:23,414 --> 00:01:25,993
Ethoxy. It's more stable.

34
00:01:26,017 --> 00:01:28,662
Easier to spread. Harder to detect.

35
00:01:28,686 --> 00:01:31,398
And lethal when it contacts the skin.

36
00:01:45,603 --> 00:01:48,549
This compound is 10 times
more potent than VX.

37
00:01:48,573 --> 00:01:50,417
If there's a deadlier
nerve agent on Earth,

38
00:01:50,441 --> 00:01:51,985
I'm not aware of it.

39
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:54,421
Call our buyer in Durres.

40
00:01:54,445 --> 00:01:56,423
Tell him the order's ready

41
00:01:56,447 --> 00:01:58,659
and to expect delivery in 48 hours.

42
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:06,433
Pig, hog, runt...

43
00:02:06,457 --> 00:02:08,235
sow...

44
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:09,925
boar.

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

46
00:02:28,821 --> 00:02:30,792
The road not taken.

47
00:02:31,382 --> 00:02:32,826
- Beauty school?
- Yes.

48
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,329
That young woman's great passion

49
00:02:35,353 --> 00:02:38,432
that her single father
just can't understand.

50
00:02:38,456 --> 00:02:40,302
It pushes them apart.

51
00:02:40,825 --> 00:02:43,937
But instead of insisting
that she understand him,

52
00:02:43,961 --> 00:02:46,473
he enrolls in beauty school as well

53
00:02:46,497 --> 00:02:50,010
and learns to better understand her.

54
00:02:50,034 --> 00:02:52,479
I think you understand Elizabeth.

55
00:02:52,503 --> 00:02:54,566
Probably more than you want to.

56
00:02:55,873 --> 00:02:57,611
Well, I'm not her father.

57
00:02:58,876 --> 00:03:02,856
Maybe if I were, I'd want to
understand her even better.

58
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,192
Perhaps she wouldn't be
so determined to kill me.

59
00:03:10,488 --> 00:03:12,433
- Morning, Dembe.
- Good morning.

60
00:03:12,457 --> 00:03:14,735
- Coffee?
- Please.

61
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,437
Something smells delicious.

62
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:18,005
Mmm. Meat and potato pie.

63
00:03:18,029 --> 00:03:21,508
Dembe brought it back from Sarajevo.

64
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:23,553
You should try a slice.

65
00:03:24,235 --> 00:03:28,048
Like all good things,
it's sinfully bad for you.

66
00:03:28,072 --> 00:03:29,650
You said you had a case?

67
00:03:29,674 --> 00:03:31,685
Yes. Thanks to Dembe.

68
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:34,388
He brought home more than Bosnian burek.

69
00:03:34,412 --> 00:03:36,523
You know that Elizabeth
used an interpreter

70
00:03:36,547 --> 00:03:38,459
to contract a bounty hunter.

71
00:03:38,483 --> 00:03:40,060
I found him in Sarajevo.

72
00:03:40,084 --> 00:03:42,296
An effective chap of ill repute.

73
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,132
Naturally, I assumed
the hunter's bounty was me.

74
00:03:45,156 --> 00:03:47,134
Unfortunately, I was mistaken.

75
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:49,837
How is not being a target unfortunate?

76
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:52,139
It's unfortunate because
each time I think

77
00:03:52,163 --> 00:03:55,075
Elizabeth won't go
to a darker place, she does.

78
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:57,544
Elizabeth wanted the bounty
hunter to kill someone else?

79
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,631
Not kill. Find.

80
00:04:00,004 --> 00:04:01,748
Someone she wanted to work with.

81
00:04:01,772 --> 00:04:03,417
And why is that so dark?

82
00:04:03,441 --> 00:04:07,055
Because the person she's working
with brokers chemical weapons.

83
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:10,123
- I don't believe that.
- Her name is Mary Bremmer.

84
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:12,392
I'm not familiar with that name.

85
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,727
Neither was I.

86
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:16,263
The bounty hunter was
unable to locate her,

87
00:04:16,287 --> 00:04:18,465
but he put together
a dossier for Elizabeth.

88
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:21,001
- Dembe got a copy of it.
- Why would she do this?

89
00:04:21,025 --> 00:04:22,903
The same reason she worked to get

90
00:04:22,927 --> 00:04:24,905
The Freelancer released from prison.

91
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:26,773
- You don't know that she did that.
- No.

92
00:04:26,797 --> 00:04:31,111
But I know her endgame...
To break me and then kill me.

93
00:04:31,135 --> 00:04:33,580
I think it's safe to assume
that she's using

94
00:04:33,604 --> 00:04:36,828
The Freelancer and Chemical
Mary to accomplish that.

95
00:04:36,852 --> 00:04:37,951
You think she's in business

96
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:40,547
with a mass murderer and a war criminal?

97
00:04:41,913 --> 00:04:45,981
As I said, it's all...
quite unfortunate.

98
00:04:47,285 --> 00:04:49,363
On the bright side,
I'm going to have a meeting

99
00:04:49,387 --> 00:04:51,999
with The Freelancer's
expensive new attorney.

100
00:04:52,023 --> 00:04:54,568
Word on the street is that his client's

101
00:04:54,592 --> 00:04:56,770
acquired identity papers, passports,

102
00:04:56,794 --> 00:04:58,605
and that he's back to work.

103
00:05:00,164 --> 00:05:01,975
I want to know what he's doing.

104
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:04,144
So we'll see what
his attorney has to say.

105
00:05:04,446 --> 00:05:06,213
The dossier on Bremmer.

106
00:05:06,237 --> 00:05:09,149
It's incomplete, but it should
give you a head start.

107
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:19,502
Not a good time. I'm doing it now.

108
00:05:20,184 --> 00:05:21,995
But this is it, Agent Keen.

109
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:25,632
Once your target is eliminated,
you and I are even.

110
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,177
I think what
you're doing is wrong.

111
00:05:37,201 --> 00:05:39,613
You're only making things worse
for Keen by pursuing her.

112
00:05:39,637 --> 00:05:42,049
Agent Park, you can rest assured...

113
00:05:42,073 --> 00:05:44,351
I've heard it all before.

114
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:47,654
It's a luxury to stand
on the moral high ground

115
00:05:47,678 --> 00:05:50,357
and critique those of us
on the low ground.

116
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:53,244
A lot of people do exactly that.

117
00:05:54,031 --> 00:05:55,942
Until they need my help.

118
00:05:56,915 --> 00:05:59,433
I'll never ask for your help.

119
00:05:59,457 --> 00:06:02,636
Mr. Cooper called with
a heads-up. We have got a case.

120
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,713
Okay.

121
00:06:04,943 --> 00:06:07,040
Oh. Uh...

122
00:06:07,676 --> 00:06:09,164
is that about your friend?

123
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,434
I'm so sorry.

124
00:06:13,571 --> 00:06:14,891
Me too.

125
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:17,677
It, uh... It sounded like
it might have been arson.

126
00:06:17,908 --> 00:06:19,486
Not "might." It was.

127
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,687
Are there suspects?

128
00:06:25,249 --> 00:06:27,227
There was, but he disappeared.

129
00:06:27,251 --> 00:06:29,396
Have you talked to Mr. Reddington?

130
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,531
I mean, he can find anyone,

131
00:06:31,555 --> 00:06:33,600
which, in this case,
it might help, right?

132
00:06:34,077 --> 00:06:35,602
I mean, if he found
the arsonist, you know,

133
00:06:35,626 --> 00:06:39,272
justice, scales, balancing,
that kind of thing.

134
00:06:39,296 --> 00:06:41,575
But then on the downside,
you'd be in his debt,

135
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:43,410
and, ohh,

136
00:06:43,434 --> 00:06:45,712
that is a record scratch
through your favorite song.

137
00:06:45,736 --> 00:06:47,716
I mean, can you even imagine?

138
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:50,117
What was it you said earlier?

139
00:06:50,141 --> 00:06:52,352
That I'd never ask for your help.

140
00:06:52,376 --> 00:06:53,720
No, that couldn't be it.

141
00:06:53,744 --> 00:06:56,808
I mean, the irony... It's crushing.

142
00:06:57,726 --> 00:07:00,394
No. I can't imagine.

143
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:03,363
Of course you can't because this is,
like, horrendous advice,

144
00:07:03,387 --> 00:07:06,566
which you are clearly
way too smart to take.

145
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,001
Anyway...

146
00:07:08,025 --> 00:07:10,203
I'm really sorry about your friend.

147
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:18,329
Will you help?

148
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:21,882
You're asking me to make it all go away.

149
00:07:24,018 --> 00:07:25,462
Say it.

150
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:27,846
Make it go away.

151
00:07:27,978 --> 00:07:29,756
And if I do this, you're aware

152
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:34,161
I may someday ask for a favor in return?

153
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:40,667
You may come to wish you'd
accepted the consequences

154
00:07:40,691 --> 00:07:43,603
of your actions here instead.

155
00:07:46,498 --> 00:07:47,817
Are we good?

156
00:07:48,966 --> 00:07:50,944
He has a video of me on his phone.

157
00:07:50,968 --> 00:07:52,115
Ah, ah, ah!

158
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,490
We'll take care of it.

159
00:07:53,971 --> 00:07:56,089
Like you were never here.

160
00:08:03,481 --> 00:08:05,492
Reddington refers to her
as Chemical Mary.

161
00:08:05,516 --> 00:08:07,227
This I.D. is more than 15 years old,

162
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:08,962
but it's the most recent photo we have.

163
00:08:08,986 --> 00:08:10,530
What we know is this...
Mary Bremmer

164
00:08:10,554 --> 00:08:13,600
is a former MIT professor
in pathobiological sciences

165
00:08:13,624 --> 00:08:16,369
who was fired for
ethical misconduct in '02.

166
00:08:16,393 --> 00:08:18,271
Apparently she questioned
the appropriateness

167
00:08:18,295 --> 00:08:20,173
of a chemical-weapons ban,
reasoning that if

168
00:08:20,197 --> 00:08:22,442
nuclear weapons are an
acceptable deterrent to war,

169
00:08:22,466 --> 00:08:24,020
why not sarin gas?

170
00:08:24,048 --> 00:08:25,663
There's always a market
for that kind of crazy.

171
00:08:25,727 --> 00:08:27,814
I mean, I assume she's found
a way to monetize it.

172
00:08:27,838 --> 00:08:29,516
Yeah. The CIA thinks so.

173
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,952
According to Langley,
Bremmer supplied the weaponry

174
00:08:31,976 --> 00:08:33,520
for the chlorine car-bomb massacre

175
00:08:33,544 --> 00:08:34,955
in the Abu Sayda market.

176
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:37,023
As for the assassination
of Kim Jong-nam,

177
00:08:37,047 --> 00:08:39,869
Bremmer's role, if any,
is still being investigated.

178
00:08:40,384 --> 00:08:42,062
I know. It doesn't seem possible.

179
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:43,630
Well, because it's not possible.

180
00:08:43,654 --> 00:08:45,799
Agent Keen would never work
with someone like this.

181
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,134
No, Agent Keen wouldn't.

182
00:08:47,158 --> 00:08:49,069
But she's not an agent anymore, is she?

183
00:08:49,093 --> 00:08:50,737
Yeah, but you don't know her like we do.

184
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:53,073
Maybe that's why I can see
what's really going on.

185
00:08:53,097 --> 00:08:55,333
What's going on is hard. On all of us.

186
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,044
But the only way to find out
what's really happening

187
00:08:58,068 --> 00:08:59,279
is to find Agent Keen.

188
00:08:59,303 --> 00:09:01,148
And right now finding Mary Bremmer

189
00:09:01,172 --> 00:09:03,176
is our best hope of doing that.

190
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,178
Okay.

191
00:09:04,202 --> 00:09:08,855
Intel placed Bremmer
in the Idlib Province in 2013,

192
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:11,191
supplying sarin to Assad forces.

193
00:09:11,215 --> 00:09:14,060
Now, a NATO operation
intercepted her convoy.

194
00:09:14,084 --> 00:09:15,962
Bremmer's vehicle was overturned
during the attack.

195
00:09:15,986 --> 00:09:17,464
Now, the shipment was stopped,

196
00:09:17,488 --> 00:09:20,333
but Bremmer escaped
and hasn't been seen since.

197
00:09:20,357 --> 00:09:22,469
Bremmer's entire security detail
was killed,

198
00:09:22,493 --> 00:09:25,998
except for one man... Ismael Aknoz.

199
00:09:26,022 --> 00:09:27,874
At the time, Aknoz refused to give

200
00:09:27,898 --> 00:09:29,309
any information on Bremmer,

201
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,378
but after eight years of isolation

202
00:09:31,402 --> 00:09:35,615
in an F-Type prison in Ankara,
maybe he'll be ready to talk.

203
00:09:42,913 --> 00:09:44,724
Ismael Aknoz? FBI.

204
00:09:44,748 --> 00:09:46,893
We'd like to talk to you
about Mary Bremmer.

205
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,872
Well. This has been productive.

206
00:09:58,896 --> 00:10:00,373
We know you speak English.

207
00:10:00,397 --> 00:10:02,676
You want Bremmer. So do I.

208
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,213
Nothing would give me more
happiness than to see her dead.

209
00:10:06,237 --> 00:10:07,547
Okay. Great. You help us find her,

210
00:10:07,571 --> 00:10:09,049
and we'd be happy to oblige you.

211
00:10:09,073 --> 00:10:10,483
Why do you want to see her dead?

212
00:10:10,507 --> 00:10:12,285
What difference does it make?

213
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:14,287
You were her partner. In her convoy.

214
00:10:14,311 --> 00:10:15,622
Why should we trust you?

215
00:10:15,646 --> 00:10:17,624
It's her fault I'm here.

216
00:10:17,648 --> 00:10:20,627
Oh, so she forced you to
transport chemical weapons?

217
00:10:20,651 --> 00:10:22,829
We did not know
they were chemical weapons.

218
00:10:22,853 --> 00:10:25,332
She told us we were moving
anti-tank missiles.

219
00:10:25,356 --> 00:10:28,488
So she lied to you, which is
why you're gonna help us.

220
00:10:28,512 --> 00:10:30,529
Thank you. No.

221
00:10:30,553 --> 00:10:32,564
I hate her, yes.

222
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:33,983
But Americans?

223
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,535
I hate you more.

224
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,770
We knew you spoke English
because our boss

225
00:10:38,794 --> 00:10:40,761
spoke with the Ministry of Justice.

226
00:10:40,785 --> 00:10:42,441
Now, you work with us, and they agreed

227
00:10:42,465 --> 00:10:44,076
to move you out of isolation.

228
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,610
We're offering you a gift.

229
00:10:45,634 --> 00:10:48,780
No matter how much you hate us,
you should take it.

230
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:55,320
Your allied forces...

231
00:10:55,344 --> 00:10:57,656
They could have stopped us that day.

232
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,257
Arrested us, peacefully.

233
00:10:59,281 --> 00:11:03,028
Instead, they set up an ambush
with an IED

234
00:11:03,052 --> 00:11:05,130
and started shooting.

235
00:11:05,154 --> 00:11:06,798
Taking the weapons wasn't enough.

236
00:11:06,822 --> 00:11:09,501
They wanted to make an example of us.

237
00:11:09,525 --> 00:11:10,802
And to do that...

238
00:11:10,826 --> 00:11:13,438
they were willing to slaughter us.

239
00:11:15,664 --> 00:11:17,609
Take your "gift" and go.

240
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:39,935
Who let you in here?!

241
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:43,305
Your assistant.
Lovely fellow. Not very savvy.

242
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:46,275
Probably not best utilized
as the gatekeeper.

243
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:50,477
Perhaps better suited
to make coffee, chit-chat.

244
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,887
I know who you are.

245
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,689
Tell me, when you go on a business trip,

246
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,759
do you charge by the hour
while you're on the plane?

247
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,759
Or in the car to the hotel?

248
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,362
Or how about when you're enjoying

249
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,766
the adult entertainment in your room?

250
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,468
Is your client paying $1,000 an hour

251
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:09,805
for every hour or minute
that you masturbate?

252
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:13,397
My goodness. And the world
thinks I'm a criminal.

253
00:12:14,506 --> 00:12:15,850
What do you want?

254
00:12:15,883 --> 00:12:18,263
For Dick the Butcher to have succeeded.

255
00:12:18,991 --> 00:12:21,836
"Henry IV, Part 2," Act IV, scene II.

256
00:12:21,861 --> 00:12:23,272
You've heard it.

257
00:12:23,297 --> 00:12:26,476
"The first thing we do,
let's kill all the lawyers."

258
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:30,492
You seem like an appropriately
loathsome place to start.

259
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:33,662
Luckily for you, I want to know
where Alban Veseli is

260
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:37,433
more than I want to sully
my hands or reputation

261
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:41,670
by something so obvious
as disposing of you.

262
00:12:42,704 --> 00:12:44,238
I don't know where he is.

263
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,241
But you know how to contact him.

264
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,377
If I do that, how do I know
you won't kill me?

265
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:51,413
Because you still have a debt to repay.

266
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,783
Elizabeth Keen paid you
to represent Veseli

267
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:57,252
with money she stole from me.

268
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,971
I want it back.

269
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,557
You want me to give you back
my retainer.

270
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:04,816
Plus interest. There's the phone.

271
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:07,720
Tell Alban his life
is in imminent danger,

272
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:11,492
that you can't discuss it over
the phone, and set a meeting.

273
00:13:11,516 --> 00:13:14,628
I think this qualifies as an emergency,

274
00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:16,397
wouldn't you say, Scooter?

275
00:13:19,448 --> 00:13:21,192
Look, I know
we're jet-lagged, so maybe

276
00:13:21,216 --> 00:13:23,819
we're not making ourselves
clear. Aknoz was a dead end.

277
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,488
No, I know he didn't say anything.

278
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:27,356
So what part of "dead end"
don't you understand?

279
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,758
He may not have said anything,

280
00:13:28,782 --> 00:13:30,930
but I think he told you a lot.

281
00:13:30,968 --> 00:13:33,444
- You have something?
- I've been studying the photos

282
00:13:33,478 --> 00:13:35,156
in the dossier that
Mr. Reddington gave us.

283
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,533
The bodies in the lead Humvee
from the convoy...

284
00:13:37,557 --> 00:13:38,955
What do they all have in common?

285
00:13:38,979 --> 00:13:40,469
Other than being really dead.

286
00:13:40,493 --> 00:13:41,804
Well, they're all burned.

287
00:13:41,828 --> 00:13:43,306
You said Aknoz was, too.

288
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,608
That's what he told us.
He was disfigured.

289
00:13:45,632 --> 00:13:47,310
- Chemical burns?
- No.

290
00:13:47,334 --> 00:13:50,246
I think there may have been
an incendiary in the IED.

291
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,882
That Humvee burned like a bonfire.

292
00:13:52,906 --> 00:13:55,341
And Bremmer only escaped
after the explosion.

293
00:13:55,366 --> 00:13:56,644
If everyone else was burned,

294
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,547
it stands to reason that she was, too.

295
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,349
If so, she couldn't have gotten
far without any medical help.

296
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:03,418
Major burns like that
will lead to hypovolemic shock

297
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,420
without timely medical intervention.

298
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,322
It is a life-threatening condition.

299
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,490
Any legitimate physician
giving her aid

300
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,126
would have turned her over
to the authorities.

301
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,295
So she found help
outside the established

302
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,931
- medical community.
- Dirtbag doctors without borders.

303
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,632
Sounds like a job for Reddington.

304
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,367
Reach out to him, see if he has

305
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,136
a medical contact who knows the area.

306
00:14:21,969 --> 00:14:23,680
Sir. The flash drive that you gave me?

307
00:14:23,704 --> 00:14:25,215
I got it back from my friend at the NSA.

308
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,816
Did he figure out the passcode?

309
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,618
Please. He's not... He's not
that much smarter than me.

310
00:14:29,643 --> 00:14:31,955
I mean, sure he knows pi
out two more places,

311
00:14:31,979 --> 00:14:33,957
but should one quinquadragintillion

312
00:14:33,981 --> 00:14:36,559
really determine who has to buy
the hot wings on bridge night?

313
00:14:36,785 --> 00:14:38,795
- I don't think so.
- So he couldn't open it?

314
00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:40,597
Uh, sorry. Not technically, no.

315
00:14:40,621 --> 00:14:42,866
He couldn't read the data,
but he was able to use

316
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,869
a USB traffic sniffer
to see the operation commands

317
00:14:45,893 --> 00:14:48,538
which bear the signature
of a known hacker.

318
00:14:48,562 --> 00:14:50,473
She goes by the name of Rakitin.

319
00:14:50,497 --> 00:14:52,742
And when I say, uh, "she,"
I don't mean she's a woman.

320
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,434
I mean, she could be. Or a man.

321
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,579
I'm... I'm trying to
alternative pronouns

322
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,448
instead of defaulting
to the generic "he"

323
00:14:58,472 --> 00:15:00,231
to represent a man or a woman.

324
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,718
Rakitin could be a he or a she.

325
00:15:03,377 --> 00:15:04,688
Or a they.

326
00:15:04,712 --> 00:15:06,857
This is good. We know who the hacker is,

327
00:15:06,881 --> 00:15:09,159
but we still need to find out what he...

328
00:15:09,183 --> 00:15:10,408
Or she... hacked.

329
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,096
And we won't know that
until you crack the passcode.

330
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,564
Right. I'm on it.

331
00:15:14,588 --> 00:15:16,667
Tell your NSA friend he did good work.

332
00:15:16,691 --> 00:15:19,953
- And buy hot wings for the month?
- Yeah... I don't think so.

333
00:15:20,714 --> 00:15:23,793
And they know to call us right away?

334
00:15:23,818 --> 00:15:25,162
Yes. They do.

335
00:15:25,187 --> 00:15:27,632
The minute The Freelancer
sets foot on U.S. soil,

336
00:15:27,657 --> 00:15:29,068
we'll know.

337
00:15:29,093 --> 00:15:30,537
Good morning!

338
00:15:30,704 --> 00:15:32,382
Would you please tell Dr. Grundig

339
00:15:32,407 --> 00:15:34,485
that Lloyd Wilke is here?

340
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:36,161
Uh, do you have an appointment?

341
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,781
Mine is a lifetime appointment.

342
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,626
Ah!

343
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,512
What a pleasant surprise.

344
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:50,074
Quite the environment
you've created here, Mickey.

345
00:15:50,098 --> 00:15:53,678
I can't tell if I'm in a waiting
room or a gentlemen's club.

346
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:58,449
My mouth is positively watering
for a smokey single-malt

347
00:15:58,473 --> 00:16:01,385
and a smooth-draw Tatuaje Fausto.

348
00:16:01,684 --> 00:16:03,562
Well, a good first impression
is imperative

349
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:06,547
to setting the tone for
a satisfied patient experience.

350
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:09,068
Hah! My goodness. How far you've come.

351
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,927
You know they used to call Mickey here

352
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,472
the Back-Room Butcher?

353
00:16:12,496 --> 00:16:14,540
If there was a cash payment involved,

354
00:16:14,564 --> 00:16:16,784
he'd operate, no questions asked.

355
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,978
Colleen, the break room could
use a fresh pot of coffee.

356
00:16:19,002 --> 00:16:20,313
You mind?

357
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,341
There wasn't a medical
procedure in the book

358
00:16:23,366 --> 00:16:26,412
you wouldn't perform...
Or at least try to.

359
00:16:26,437 --> 00:16:28,949
Of course that was after
they stripped your license.

360
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,476
Cocaine, was it?

361
00:16:30,501 --> 00:16:32,680
But you kicked that and saved up enough

362
00:16:32,705 --> 00:16:36,184
to buy a brand-new identity
from me and look at you now!

363
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,215
Raymond. Please.
If any of this ever got out...

364
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:40,550
Well, it doesn't have to. Listen.

365
00:16:40,574 --> 00:16:43,352
I'm looking for a woman
named Mary Bremmer.

366
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,755
Three years ago, she had a mishap

367
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,824
near the Syrian-Turkish border.

368
00:16:47,848 --> 00:16:51,443
Suffered terrible burns
requiring the kind of

369
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,970
discrete medical care you once provided.

370
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,054
I don't know her.

371
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,950
But I suspect you may know
the sawbones who treated her.

372
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,887
You want me to sell out another doctor?

373
00:16:59,911 --> 00:17:02,189
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

374
00:17:02,213 --> 00:17:04,725
the patient trades in chemical weapons.

375
00:17:04,749 --> 00:17:07,772
She's a scourge on the human race.

376
00:17:07,796 --> 00:17:11,198
Help me find her, and your past...

377
00:17:11,229 --> 00:17:13,065
remains in the past.

378
00:17:16,852 --> 00:17:19,364
I require a demonstration
before I commit

379
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:21,666
such significant resources.

380
00:17:21,815 --> 00:17:23,092
I hope you don't mind.

381
00:17:23,116 --> 00:17:25,695
Not at all. I expected as much.

382
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:27,664
If, uh, one of your men

383
00:17:27,688 --> 00:17:31,134
would retrieve the briefcase
in my trunk?

384
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,335
Bujare.

385
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,346
What is wrong?

386
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:47,359
You asked for a demonstration.

387
00:17:49,624 --> 00:17:51,303
I'm giving you one.

388
00:18:03,774 --> 00:18:05,941
Thanks to Mr. Reddington,
we got the identity

389
00:18:05,966 --> 00:18:07,352
of the physician
who treated Mary Bremmer.

390
00:18:07,376 --> 00:18:09,320
Yeah, but in Turkey.
It's gonna take us months

391
00:18:09,344 --> 00:18:10,524
to obtain a search and seizure there.

392
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,204
Given that his
records may hold the key

393
00:18:12,228 --> 00:18:14,188
to our tracking a purveyor
of banned weapons,

394
00:18:14,223 --> 00:18:15,858
Main Justice authorized a shortcut

395
00:18:15,882 --> 00:18:17,693
by working with Turkish intelligence.

396
00:18:17,717 --> 00:18:19,595
Hacking his medical records.

397
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:21,964
So you were right.
She was burned in the Humvee.

398
00:18:21,988 --> 00:18:24,119
Badly enough to require
multiple skin grafts

399
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,855
as well as personalized prosthetics.

400
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:28,324
Now, these photos were taken
within a few days of the incident.

401
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:31,227
But these... were taken a year later.

402
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,154
No wonder we couldn't find her.

403
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,113
We ran her current looks
through the Interpol database.

404
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,391
What did it kick back?

405
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,301
A single touch
or an inhaled droplet

406
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,037
disrupts the nerve signals

407
00:18:41,061 --> 00:18:44,708
to his muscles, his heart, and lungs.

408
00:18:44,732 --> 00:18:45,842
In a matter of seconds,

409
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:48,612
breathing will not be option.

410
00:18:48,636 --> 00:18:50,280
Six nationalities. Six aliases.

411
00:18:50,304 --> 00:18:53,283
All active, but according
to passport-control archives,

412
00:18:53,307 --> 00:18:55,786
the last one she used was yesterday.

413
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:58,755
In Paris. Madeline Toussaint.

414
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:01,691
Remarkable. The delivery system?

415
00:19:01,715 --> 00:19:04,315
One drop on the key fob was all it took.

416
00:19:04,339 --> 00:19:06,429
Odorless, invisible.

417
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:09,199
Lasts for days on any hard surface.

418
00:19:09,223 --> 00:19:12,335
Or load it into a crop duster
and take out a town.

419
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,527
It's up to you.

420
00:19:13,794 --> 00:19:15,923
Killing's never been easier.

421
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,405
For the last nine months,

422
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,484
Mary Bremmer's been living
as Madeline Toussaint

423
00:19:19,508 --> 00:19:21,553
in the Batignolles district of Paris.

424
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,871
She has a cover job as a quality
engineer at a chemical plant.

425
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,158
Contact Interpol.
Have them issue a Red Notice

426
00:19:27,182 --> 00:19:29,160
for Bremmer's conditional arrest
and extradition

427
00:19:29,184 --> 00:19:30,328
based on our charges.

428
00:19:30,352 --> 00:19:32,063
Then let's get a team to Paris.

429
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,057
I'll go to Paris.

430
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,714
I need your help with that passcode.

431
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,090
Well, I could look for it in Paris.

432
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,944
You know, sidewalk café, pot of
coffee, couple'a croissants.

433
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,781
I'm on my way to Capitol Hill
to ask about Rakitin.

434
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,317
I doubt I'll get much traction
until you find out

435
00:19:44,341 --> 00:19:45,679
what's on that drive.

436
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,055
I guess that's a no
on that coffee and croissants.

437
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:52,058
We'll say hi to Mona Lisa for you.

438
00:19:56,052 --> 00:19:58,097
Thank you for
taking the time, Congressman.

439
00:19:58,121 --> 00:20:00,582
Always happy to make time for the FBI.

440
00:20:00,663 --> 00:20:02,366
Though I am surprised
there was no heads-up

441
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,378
what you wanted to talk about.
Please, sit.

442
00:20:04,402 --> 00:20:07,415
Take a load off and tell me
what is so hush-hush

443
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:10,208
I get an Assistant Director
to make a house call.

444
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,988
A hacker who goes by the name Rakitin.

445
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:14,522
Never heard of him.

446
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,124
- Excuse me?
- Anything else?

447
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,326
Because I got a local Elks Club
waiting to take a photo.

448
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,062
Congressman. You chair
the House Intel Committee.

449
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:24,132
I've read your report
on Russian cyber intrusion.

450
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,994
I know you know who Rakitin is.

451
00:20:27,265 --> 00:20:29,119
What I know is your title.

452
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:32,651
What I don't know is what you do
because no one would tell me.

453
00:20:32,808 --> 00:20:34,952
Yeah, I chair the Intel Committee,

454
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,572
but for some reason,
I can't get any intel on you.

455
00:20:37,597 --> 00:20:39,242
I run a classified task force.

456
00:20:39,267 --> 00:20:42,179
- That's interested in Rakitin.
- Why would that surprise you?

457
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:44,302
I doesn't. It troubles me.

458
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,504
Rakitin has friends in high places.

459
00:20:46,528 --> 00:20:48,567
I want to make sure
I'm not talking to one.

460
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:52,025
I'm sorry. I'm...
I'm completely confused.

461
00:20:52,401 --> 00:20:54,913
Three weeks ago, the hard drive

462
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:57,072
on my committee's computer was hacked.

463
00:20:57,406 --> 00:20:59,733
All the intel we had on Rakitin
was destroyed.

464
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,470
- I had no idea.
- My top staffer on the committee

465
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:03,928
disappeared the day it happened.

466
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,406
Vanished into thin air.

467
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,000
And she was a patriot. A good person.

468
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,810
But someone got to her.

469
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:12,280
And if they got to her,
maybe they got to you.

470
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:15,783
Maybe you're here to see
what I know about Rakitin,

471
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,385
and if I know too much,

472
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,553
maybe you're gonna want
to erase my hard drive.

473
00:21:19,577 --> 00:21:22,892
Here's a name and a number.
Call it. Ask about me.

474
00:21:23,514 --> 00:21:27,811
If you're satisfied with what
you hear, we can talk more.

475
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:31,098
If not, thank you for your time.

476
00:21:31,122 --> 00:21:33,434
I'm sure it seems like
I'm being overly paranoid.

477
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,570
If we do talk, I'd like to
hear more about that hack.

478
00:21:36,844 --> 00:21:38,522
I have some paranoia of my own

479
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,490
about who might have been behind it.

480
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,634
Rogelio. I hear you have news.

481
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,413
A location... and a room number.

482
00:21:46,437 --> 00:21:47,472
Ah.

483
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:50,417
A youth hostel.

484
00:21:50,441 --> 00:21:52,453
How unexpectedly romantic.

485
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,372
Is there anywhere you
don't have eyes and ears?

486
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,917
I got either a maid, a waiter,
a waitress, a busboy,

487
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,735
or a bellhop
in every corner of the city.

488
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:01,980
Thank you, my friend.

489
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:04,483
And please give my regards to Carlos.

490
00:22:04,507 --> 00:22:08,222
Unfortunately,
he's been deported... again.

491
00:22:08,348 --> 00:22:10,966
And your friend's tunnel
in Calexico has been shut down.

492
00:22:10,967 --> 00:22:13,664
Ah, the goings-on at the border.

493
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,144
One side builds, the other shuts down.

494
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,046
They hide, they seek,
they come, they go.

495
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,547
It's all so... "Tom and Jerry."

496
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,417
Yes, the tunnel is closed,

497
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,352
but the submarine is fully operational.

498
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,621
And for tracking down Alban Veseli,

499
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:29,206
it will always be at your disposal.

500
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:40,068
I once had a brief dust-up
with an Armenian fellow

501
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,070
who took umbrage at my acquisition

502
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:44,624
of a pipeline outside Kajaran.

503
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:48,342
I tried to avoid him
by hiding out in a hostel.

504
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,611
- You "tried." Did he find you?
- No.

505
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:54,715
But after three days of communal
showers and curdled yogurt,

506
00:22:54,739 --> 00:22:57,934
James Taylor wannabes,
I couldn't stand it anymore.

507
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,405
So I stole a backpack
and a Fodor's Guide

508
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:02,994
and hiked to Turkey
through the Armenian Highlands.

509
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:04,965
The Highlands. Mount Ararat.

510
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,377
Yes. And FYI... no Ark.

511
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:12,809
Ah. Some things never change.

512
00:23:16,837 --> 00:23:20,651
No cameras. No security.
Smart place to lay low.

513
00:23:32,462 --> 00:23:34,386
Not here.

514
00:23:36,924 --> 00:23:38,650
Ah!

515
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,920
Running in a towel never ends well.

516
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,740
Put some pants on, and let's talk.

517
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:53,889
I did
as you suggested, Mr. Cooper.

518
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,118
Checked up on
you with Cynthia Panabaker.

519
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,455
A straight arrow if ever there was one.

520
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,539
- She likes you.
- Does she, now?

521
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,041
Well, she said,
"He won't pee on your leg

522
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,677
and tell you it's rainin'."

523
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:06,712
Sounds like Cynthia.

524
00:24:07,161 --> 00:24:08,847
You said before that you were looking

525
00:24:08,871 --> 00:24:10,948
for information about Rakitin.

526
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,394
I'm curious what your committee
knows about him.

527
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:15,196
Not a hell of a lot, to be honest.

528
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,565
We don't have an I.D.

529
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:19,933
Hell, Rakitin could be an entire
hacker group for all we know.

530
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,704
But he's using a series
of servers in Volgograd,

531
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:26,098
and he is targeting some of our
most carefully guarded secrets.

532
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,591
- Such as...?
- The identities

533
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,875
of CIA assets in Yasenevo...

534
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:32,341
their funding sources,

535
00:24:32,365 --> 00:24:34,712
hacks of our own internal
threat assessments.

536
00:24:34,736 --> 00:24:36,413
What does he do with this intel?

537
00:24:36,437 --> 00:24:37,948
There are a lot of theories.

538
00:24:37,972 --> 00:24:40,384
NSA thinks he's
a black-market profiteer.

539
00:24:40,408 --> 00:24:42,453
CIA's convinced he's a turncoat.

540
00:24:42,477 --> 00:24:43,895
And what do you think?

541
00:24:45,213 --> 00:24:47,892
Have you ever heard of N-13?

542
00:24:47,916 --> 00:24:49,393
Sleeper agent.

543
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:51,462
A Russian asset who vanished
during the Cold War

544
00:24:51,486 --> 00:24:53,197
and was never proven to exist.

545
00:24:53,221 --> 00:24:55,165
It's a 30-year-old ghost story.

546
00:24:56,075 --> 00:24:57,657
What if it's not?

547
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:02,273
What if that asset is here?

548
00:25:02,442 --> 00:25:05,282
Not only active and deeply embedded,

549
00:25:05,307 --> 00:25:08,524
but maneuvering
within our intel community?

550
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,193
I don't know whose trust
he might have gained...

551
00:25:11,217 --> 00:25:14,497
CIA, Defense Intelligence...
God forbid, the FBI.

552
00:25:14,521 --> 00:25:18,868
But I think he's been here a long time.

553
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,237
Long enough, he's become one of us.

554
00:25:21,261 --> 00:25:22,905
And he's using us.

555
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:25,875
You think Rakitin's feeding
active intel to N-13.

556
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,276
I do.

557
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,044
I think I'm the only man on this hill

558
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:32,659
who may believe your ghost story
about a Russian spy.

559
00:25:32,683 --> 00:25:34,150
Go on.

560
00:25:34,174 --> 00:25:36,286
We've recently intercepted a thumb drive

561
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:39,556
containing sensitive intel we
believe was obtained by Rakitin.

562
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,325
I suspect he intended to
deliver that drive to N-13.

563
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:43,793
Why do you say that?

564
00:25:43,817 --> 00:25:47,163
Did anything on the drive identify N-13?

565
00:25:47,187 --> 00:25:50,190
All I can say is our source
believes it was intended

566
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,915
for someone on our Most Wanted List.

567
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,718
Well, whoever your source is,
he or she is way off base.

568
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,830
I'm telling you... N-13 is buried

569
00:25:56,854 --> 00:25:59,099
deep within the U.S. government.

570
00:25:59,123 --> 00:26:02,502
That said, I strongly encourage
you to follow up on it.

571
00:26:02,526 --> 00:26:04,538
Based on what I know of Rakitin,

572
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:08,775
he and N-13 pose an imminent
threat to national security.

573
00:26:12,262 --> 00:26:15,842
I must admit I'm surprised
you took this contract, Alban.

574
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:18,178
I'd never pretend to call us friends,

575
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:20,346
but we are professional associates.

576
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:21,915
It's a job.

577
00:26:21,939 --> 00:26:24,933
Unbridled resentment. Is that
what this is all about?

578
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,387
You somehow blame me
for you going to prison.

579
00:26:27,411 --> 00:26:29,956
- You are why I went to prison.
- No.

580
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:32,967
You went to prison because
you were caught doing a job

581
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:34,569
I hired you to do.

582
00:26:34,701 --> 00:26:37,654
Don't blame me for your
failed cut-and-run.

583
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,225
I've been in that box for seven years.

584
00:26:40,249 --> 00:26:43,495
And now you're out.
Because of Elizabeth Keen.

585
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,897
That is why you're aligned
with her, isn't it?

586
00:26:45,921 --> 00:26:47,999
You bear me resentment for your failure,

587
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,968
and now you both want me dead?

588
00:26:49,992 --> 00:26:51,803
What's he so worked up about?

589
00:26:51,827 --> 00:26:55,807
Talk to me about Agent Keen.
Tell me where I can find her.

590
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:57,075
No idea.

591
00:26:57,099 --> 00:26:58,683
Raymond.

592
00:27:05,315 --> 00:27:08,427
You just flew in from Paris.
What were you doing there?

593
00:27:08,451 --> 00:27:10,863
Taking a tour of the Temple de I'Amour?

594
00:27:10,987 --> 00:27:13,432
Strolling along the Canal Saint-Martin?

595
00:27:13,456 --> 00:27:16,869
What do you think?
I was setting up the job.

596
00:27:16,893 --> 00:27:20,071
- I have no plans to be in France.
- So?

597
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:22,875
So how were you going to
carry out your contract?

598
00:27:22,899 --> 00:27:25,711
What's wrong with him?
How were you going to kill me?

599
00:27:27,447 --> 00:27:29,437
The contract's not on you.

600
00:27:30,306 --> 00:27:32,508
Who were you hired to kill?

601
00:27:35,635 --> 00:27:37,172
Madeline Toussaint.

602
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,408
At least that's the name
she's using right now.

603
00:27:39,432 --> 00:27:41,377
This is the address
she gave her current employer.

604
00:27:41,401 --> 00:27:44,013
If she's here, we're gonna have
to make the provisional arrest.

605
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,715
You can file for extradition afterward.

606
00:27:45,739 --> 00:27:47,357
We're just here for backup.

607
00:27:57,117 --> 00:27:59,339
_

608
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,721
_

609
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:02,745
_

610
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,770
_

611
00:28:04,795 --> 00:28:05,816
_

612
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,426
_

613
00:28:09,881 --> 00:28:11,881
_

614
00:28:14,095 --> 00:28:16,252
_

615
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,047
_

616
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,614
Where is she?

617
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:23,239
_

618
00:28:23,377 --> 00:28:26,578
She's visiting an aunt in
Albania. She'll be back later today.

619
00:28:26,627 --> 00:28:28,627
_

620
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,840
_

621
00:28:33,053 --> 00:28:34,193
Gun!

622
00:28:38,992 --> 00:28:40,837
Hang on. We'll get help.

623
00:28:45,498 --> 00:28:46,925
She's dead.

624
00:28:47,848 --> 00:28:50,537
You know how much I love
I told you so, Harold,

625
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,938
so I confirmed the fact
straight from the source.

626
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,874
Elizabeth sprung The Freelancer

627
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,459
so she could engage his services.

628
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,860
I refuse to believe that.

629
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,605
Alban Veseli cloaks
assassination in mass murder.

630
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,114
I don't care how far she's slipped,

631
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,327
Agent Keen would never use
The Freelancer to kill you.

632
00:29:04,351 --> 00:29:06,763
You're half-right. She didn't
hire him to kill me.

633
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:09,489
She hired him to kill Chemical Mary.

634
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,183
- Mary Bremmer. Why?
- I'm not sure.

635
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:14,519
I'm hoping a slightly more creative

636
00:29:14,543 --> 00:29:18,290
line of questioning will
persuade him to reveal his plan.

637
00:29:18,314 --> 00:29:21,994
But one thing is clear...
It's already in motion.

638
00:29:22,018 --> 00:29:24,663
Ressler's at Bremmer's
residence in Paris now.

639
00:29:24,687 --> 00:29:26,898
She's apparently flying back
from Albania today.

640
00:29:26,922 --> 00:29:29,735
A transcontinental flight
filled with innocent passengers?

641
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:31,503
We're contacting the airlines now.

642
00:29:31,527 --> 00:29:33,727
_

643
00:29:34,244 --> 00:29:36,244
_

644
00:29:39,418 --> 00:29:41,418
_

645
00:29:41,777 --> 00:29:43,048
_

646
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:44,716
Merci!

647
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,351
Move swiftly, Harold.

648
00:29:46,817 --> 00:29:48,762
If Mary Bremmer boards that plane...

649
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,765
I'll bet you nickels to navy beans

650
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,608
the only way it comes down is in pieces.

651
00:29:59,921 --> 00:30:01,840
We got a hit on one
of Bremmer's passports.

652
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:04,362
She's currently en route
to France on Parisian Air.

653
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:05,943
Okay. We're 10 minutes
from Charles de Gaulle.

654
00:30:05,967 --> 00:30:08,364
- How long before she lands?
- About a half an hour,

655
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,557
but we have to assume
that plane won't land.

656
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,670
There are 162 passengers
on board, including families.

657
00:30:13,694 --> 00:30:14,899
And he'll kill everyone.

658
00:30:14,935 --> 00:30:17,007
Wait. I thought The Freelancer
was going after Reddington.

659
00:30:17,031 --> 00:30:18,341
That's what we all thought.

660
00:30:18,365 --> 00:30:19,643
Alright. The airline's
confirming that Bremmer's

661
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:21,244
on the boarded-passenger manifest.

662
00:30:21,268 --> 00:30:23,246
So Keen's taking out
a chemical arms trader...

663
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,590
Air hugs for that...
But she's gonna waste a plane

664
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,133
full of passengers in the process?

665
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,352
Have the airport authority
prepare for contingencies...

666
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:31,805
Rescue units, medics.
You know the routine.

667
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,515
Okay. Thank you. Uh, I've got the tower.

668
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,016
I've got air-traffic control
on the line.

669
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,333
Call me when you're on site.

670
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,711
Copy that.

671
00:30:38,054 --> 00:30:39,431
Hello. This is Harold Cooper.

672
00:30:39,455 --> 00:30:41,300
I'm the Assistant Director of the FBI

673
00:30:41,324 --> 00:30:43,006
calling from Washington, D.C.

674
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,770
Stephan Gervais. ATC Supervisor.
What's going on?

675
00:30:45,794 --> 00:30:47,367
We have a credible threat
that someone's trying

676
00:30:47,407 --> 00:30:50,042
to bring down Parisian Air flight 2419.

677
00:30:50,066 --> 00:30:52,811
- Really? How?
- Well, we don't know that yet, Stephan.

678
00:30:52,835 --> 00:30:54,226
We need your help figuring it out.

679
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,270
Parisian Air 2-4-1 niner.

680
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,900
Are you currently experiencing

681
00:30:57,924 --> 00:31:00,274
any problems or equipment malfunctions?

682
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:03,973
Negative, Tower. Everything is
showing normal at this time.

683
00:31:03,997 --> 00:31:06,530
Anything unusual show up
in your preflight checklist?

684
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,544
Nothing. May I ask why?

685
00:31:08,885 --> 00:31:11,397
Switch to discrete frequency 133.6.

686
00:31:12,606 --> 00:31:13,850
What do you want me to tell them?

687
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:15,418
Should they be looking for a bomb?

688
00:31:15,442 --> 00:31:16,456
Suspect engages

689
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,401
in terrorist activities
disguised as accidents.

690
00:31:18,425 --> 00:31:20,061
It's doubtful he'd use explosives.

691
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,897
Okay, he was physically on that plane.

692
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:24,190
Airport security has footage
of him entering the cabin

693
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,549
along with the cleaning crew.

694
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,193
Tower, is there anything

695
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,962
we should be worried about up here?

696
00:31:28,986 --> 00:31:30,631
We've just begun our descent.

697
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:31,763
Stand by. One moment.

698
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,309
They just started their descent.

699
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:35,967
- The instrument panel.
- What about it?

700
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,998
Seven years ago, Veseli
derailed a passenger trail

701
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:43,026
by making it hit a curve too fast.

702
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,475
Clear! Clear out!

703
00:31:52,936 --> 00:31:56,079
He did that by rigging
the two speed-data sources

704
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,091
in the control cabin
to show the train traveling

705
00:31:58,115 --> 00:32:00,493
at a slower speed than its actual rate.

706
00:32:00,517 --> 00:32:03,363
Can your pilots check their
controls for signs of tampering?

707
00:32:03,387 --> 00:32:05,598
Parisian Air 2-4-1 niner, it's possible

708
00:32:05,622 --> 00:32:07,925
your flight controls have been
physically compromised.

709
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,010
Can you take a careful look around?

710
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,096
Roger. Stand by, Tower.

711
00:32:27,134 --> 00:32:29,505
- There is a thumb drive here.
- We got something.

712
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,809
Someone left a thumb drive
inside the Data Loader.

713
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:34,511
There's a panel inside the cockpit

714
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,119
for software and database updates.

715
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,731
Someone left a thumb drive inside.

716
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:39,600
Which could be corrupting
their instruments

717
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,402
or running its own scripts.

718
00:32:42,103 --> 00:32:43,061
Oh, no.

719
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:45,097
You said the plane's
making its approach.

720
00:32:45,121 --> 00:32:47,333
Are your tracking systems
showing anything unusual?

721
00:32:47,357 --> 00:32:49,602
Our GPS system is based
entirely on information

722
00:32:49,626 --> 00:32:51,337
transmitted to us from the aircraft.

723
00:32:51,361 --> 00:32:53,272
If that plane isn't where
it should be right now,

724
00:32:53,296 --> 00:32:54,840
we would not know it from down here.

725
00:32:54,864 --> 00:32:56,676
Okay, that data stick
wasn't left there by accident.

726
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,313
It is a brute-force attack.
Take it out! Take it out now!

727
00:33:00,337 --> 00:33:01,681
Parisian Air 2-4-1 niner.

728
00:33:01,705 --> 00:33:03,516
Remove the drive from the Data Loader.

729
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,051
I repeat! Remove the drive!

730
00:33:05,075 --> 00:33:07,760
Copy, Tower.

731
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:11,057
Warning.

732
00:33:11,081 --> 00:33:11,948
Warning.

733
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,797
- Warning.
- Autopilot off!

734
00:33:17,821 --> 00:33:19,772
Flight directors off.

735
00:33:31,835 --> 00:33:32,827
What's going on?

736
00:33:33,682 --> 00:33:35,881
They're too low. Immediate right turn!

737
00:33:35,905 --> 00:33:37,550
Heading 2-3-zero!

738
00:33:37,574 --> 00:33:39,785
Traffic is directly in front of you!

739
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,387
I have control!

740
00:33:56,259 --> 00:33:58,404
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm terribly sorry

741
00:33:58,428 --> 00:34:00,370
for that sudden shift in altitude.

742
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,122
We obviously had an incident,

743
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:05,678
but we are safe and on course
and will be landing shortly.

744
00:34:14,978 --> 00:34:17,690
- What's happening?!
- Uh, are... are they dying?

745
00:34:17,714 --> 00:34:18,722
No, sir.

746
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,327
I believe those are
cries of celebration.

747
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:24,978
Tower. Parisian Air 2-4-1 niner.

748
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:28,091
We are clear of the traffic
and climbing to 8,000.

749
00:34:28,391 --> 00:34:30,677
We will be begin
our approach for landing.

750
00:34:49,312 --> 00:34:52,191
Excuse me. A passenger. Mary Bremmer?

751
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,025
Oh, that's it. That's everyone.

752
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,402
- Are you sure?
- Feel free to take a look,

753
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,011
but I checked the cabins personally.

754
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,912
There's no one left on the plane.

755
00:35:06,796 --> 00:35:08,779
Mary Bremmer was not ever on that plane.

756
00:35:08,803 --> 00:35:10,337
She made it to the airport,

757
00:35:10,362 --> 00:35:12,618
but she was abducted
outside the terminal.

758
00:35:14,485 --> 00:35:16,530
What about the passenger manifest?

759
00:35:16,723 --> 00:35:18,601
You said it showed her on board.

760
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:20,624
Shortly after Bremmer was taken,

761
00:35:20,648 --> 00:35:23,096
an unidentified woman
entered the terminal

762
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,967
with her passport and ticket,
which was slipped into the purse

763
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:28,125
of an unsuspecting passenger
at the gate.

764
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,706
The unidentified woman
then left the terminal,

765
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:33,430
and the passenger boarded
the flight as Bremmer.

766
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:38,347
This "unidentified woman."
She look familiar to you?

767
00:35:38,774 --> 00:35:42,084
These are the best images
we could pull, but, yes...

768
00:35:42,108 --> 00:35:43,919
we believe it's Keen.

769
00:35:43,943 --> 00:35:48,663
So, Elizabeth conducted
an operatic performance,

770
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,067
getting an assassin out of prison,

771
00:35:51,091 --> 00:35:54,403
elaborately sabotaging
a commercial airliner,

772
00:35:54,427 --> 00:35:57,922
only to snatch her target
from the jaws of death

773
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,490
at the last second?

774
00:36:00,141 --> 00:36:02,191
Perhaps she wanted the world to believe

775
00:36:02,215 --> 00:36:04,093
Bremmer died in that crash.

776
00:36:05,761 --> 00:36:07,263
To what end?

777
00:36:07,523 --> 00:36:09,265
I can't fathom.

778
00:36:09,692 --> 00:36:12,094
It's more likely Elizabeth wanted

779
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:14,397
Bremmer to think she saved her life,

780
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,667
which would put Bremmer
in Elizabeth's debt.

781
00:36:16,949 --> 00:36:18,260
Whatever they're working on,

782
00:36:18,284 --> 00:36:20,260
we're gonna make it
as difficult as possible.

783
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:23,665
Our people are combing through
Bremmer's flat in Paris

784
00:36:23,689 --> 00:36:25,473
and have ID'd a number of associates.

785
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:27,436
Teams are en route as we speak.

786
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,645
I still can't get over
the fact that Elizabeth

787
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:33,642
was willing to let
The Freelancer crash two planes.

788
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:38,113
I was holding out hope for her.
We all were.

789
00:36:38,137 --> 00:36:42,725
But now? It seems she's past
the point of no return.

790
00:36:43,376 --> 00:36:45,487
- FBI!
- Turn around!

791
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:46,822
Give me your hands!

792
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:51,894
I'll try to leave the
moralizing to you, Harold.

793
00:36:54,453 --> 00:36:58,355
In the meantime, perhaps
this will ease your pain.

794
00:36:59,225 --> 00:37:02,704
Tell Donald to pay a visit
to this address.

795
00:37:02,728 --> 00:37:04,173
What is this?

796
00:37:04,283 --> 00:37:06,199
Your team worked very hard to put

797
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:09,704
The Freelancer behind bars
the first time around.

798
00:37:10,211 --> 00:37:13,090
I think that's probably
the right place for him.

799
00:37:20,187 --> 00:37:21,800
Thank you for the Scotch.

800
00:37:38,698 --> 00:37:40,809
Whoa, whoa. Easy, brah.

801
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:43,494
The man in the hat
said the popo would be here.

802
00:37:49,375 --> 00:37:51,351
Why does this feel like
an empty victory?

803
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:52,852
Because this guy has no idea

804
00:37:52,876 --> 00:37:55,006
what Keen's up to with Chemical Mary.

805
00:37:56,047 --> 00:37:58,108
Open this door right now!

806
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,567
I want to see her!

807
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:03,047
Where is she?! The woman!

808
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:05,483
I want to talk to her!

809
00:38:05,757 --> 00:38:07,468
Do you hear me?!

810
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,504
Ugh!

811
00:38:09,729 --> 00:38:13,643
Open this door right now!
I want to see her!

812
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,850
Angela is the one you were asking about.

813
00:38:21,073 --> 00:38:23,993
She's the one who told me
that Veseli was at the hostel.

814
00:38:24,243 --> 00:38:26,788
Angela, I can't thank you enough.

815
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:28,615
I just have one question.

816
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:33,087
I need to know how you came
by this valuable information.

817
00:38:34,129 --> 00:38:36,453
_

818
00:38:37,127 --> 00:38:38,605
It was...

819
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:41,278
a woman.

820
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,930
This woman?

821
00:38:43,262 --> 00:38:44,430
Ah.

822
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:47,167
I, uh, asked her

823
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:50,203
how she know that I was looking for him.

824
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:51,646
She wouldn't say.

825
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:53,183
Gracias.

826
00:38:55,999 --> 00:38:57,843
Oh, and your cousin Carlos.

827
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:01,772
I'm told he's somewhere under
the Gulf of Mexico as we speak.

828
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,542
Muchas gracias, Raymond.

829
00:39:03,566 --> 00:39:05,043
If there's anything I can do for you...

830
00:39:05,067 --> 00:39:07,979
You've done more than you know.
And all to the good.

831
00:39:11,473 --> 00:39:13,167
Well, that's a load off.

832
00:39:13,943 --> 00:39:16,621
Elizabeth wanted you
to find The Freelancer.

833
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:17,756
Yeah.

834
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:20,750
Knowing that when we did,
we'd work with the FBI

835
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,053
to stop him from crashing that plane.

836
00:39:23,077 --> 00:39:26,657
So she hires a lawyer
to obtain Veseli's freedom,

837
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:28,825
pays Veseli to crash a plane,

838
00:39:28,849 --> 00:39:32,362
uses the threat of that crash
to gain Chemical Mary's trust,

839
00:39:32,386 --> 00:39:35,432
gives us intel to keep
the plane from going down.

840
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,367
Sounds like one of your plans.

841
00:39:37,391 --> 00:39:38,669
It doesn't, doesn't it?

842
00:39:38,693 --> 00:39:41,505
She may not be interested
in crash a plane,

843
00:39:41,529 --> 00:39:43,974
but she's still in business
with a war criminal.

844
00:39:43,998 --> 00:39:45,442
Tomorrow's problem.

845
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,902
Tonight, we savor the small victory.

846
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:50,872
And we should tell Edward
to fuel the jet.

847
00:39:50,896 --> 00:39:54,042
We need to pay our friend
in Moscow a visit.

848
00:39:58,045 --> 00:40:00,390
Uh, hi. Um, sir, uh, sorry to...

849
00:40:00,414 --> 00:40:03,794
It's, uh, late, and, uh,
you're drinking... alone...

850
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,096
Uh, which is... which is, fine.
I mean, I can...

851
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,531
What is it?

852
00:40:07,555 --> 00:40:10,000
- Good news on the passcode.
- You cracked it.

853
00:40:10,024 --> 00:40:11,553
What? Oh, uh, no.

854
00:40:11,732 --> 00:40:14,303
Uh, that would be great news,
like miraculously great.

855
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:16,939
No. Uh, the good news is
I figured out how to crack it.

856
00:40:17,898 --> 00:40:18,931
With this.

857
00:40:19,312 --> 00:40:21,769
I don't think Rakitin chose
a steel flash drive

858
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,138
to protect his software.

859
00:40:23,162 --> 00:40:24,973
If I'm right, there's
a capacitive scanner

860
00:40:24,997 --> 00:40:26,608
hidden in the flash drive.

861
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:29,644
It is the best security platform
in passwordless identification.

862
00:40:29,668 --> 00:40:31,070
So there's no password.

863
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:34,175
It's biometric. And that
is where this comes in.

864
00:40:34,582 --> 00:40:36,460
Get the print, put it in, and...

865
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:38,511
...open sesame.

866
00:40:38,535 --> 00:40:40,046
Or, um, you know, some less

867
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,148
politically incorrect exclamation.

868
00:40:42,172 --> 00:40:44,784
- So all I need is a fingerprint.
- Yeah.

869
00:40:44,808 --> 00:40:46,938
And that is where the miracle comes in.

870
00:40:47,163 --> 00:40:48,892
Figuring out whose print to use.

871
00:40:50,558 --> 00:40:52,436
Thank you, Aram.

872
00:40:52,902 --> 00:40:54,661
Here's hoping for a miracle.

873
00:41:14,789 --> 00:41:15,856
Raymond!

874
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,501

875
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,462
_

876
00:41:24,338 --> 00:41:25,747
_

877
00:41:31,629 --> 00:41:35,309
Thank you for coming.
We have much to discuss.

878
00:41:35,866 --> 00:41:38,437
I am told Rakitin is in play.

879
00:41:38,669 --> 00:41:41,081
My safe deposit box was compromised.

880
00:41:42,316 --> 00:41:44,759
The flash drive I entrusted you with?

881
00:41:44,783 --> 00:41:46,094
I'm still looking for it.

882
00:41:46,195 --> 00:41:48,731
No doubt we have Elizabeth Keen to thank

883
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,116
for it going missing.

884
00:41:50,381 --> 00:41:53,494
My position in regard to her
has not changed.

885
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:56,357
I understand. She is untouchable.

886
00:41:56,707 --> 00:41:58,819
But you must understand...

887
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:01,920
Harold Cooper is not.

888
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:14,014
Will miracles never cease?

889
00:42:14,223 --> 00:42:17,660
If he gains access to the Rakitin files,

890
00:42:18,026 --> 00:42:20,440
you'll have to eliminate him.

891
00:42:23,022 --> 00:42:24,885
I understand.
