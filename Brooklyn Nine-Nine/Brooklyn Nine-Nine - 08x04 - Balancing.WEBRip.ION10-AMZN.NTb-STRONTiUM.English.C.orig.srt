1
00:00:04,351 --> 00:00:06,285
Listen up, everyone.
We had a murder this morning.

2
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:09,149
The vic was found at 8:45
by a dog walker

3
00:00:09,173 --> 00:00:10,484
who let herself into his apartment...

4
00:00:10,508 --> 00:00:11,860
Oh, my God, it's Franzia!

5
00:00:11,884 --> 00:00:14,320
This is the work of
Johnny Franzia, my white whale.

6
00:00:14,344 --> 00:00:15,479
He's finally resurfaced.

7
00:00:15,503 --> 00:00:17,241
- Not this again.
- Yes, this again.

8
00:00:17,265 --> 00:00:19,381
Johnny Franzia has been
on a murder spree

9
00:00:19,405 --> 00:00:20,759
for the past ten years,

10
00:00:20,783 --> 00:00:23,085
and every time
he kills someone, he taunts me.

11
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:24,373
Look, there's a deck of cards.

12
00:00:24,397 --> 00:00:26,225
You say that whenever
there's cards at a crime scene.

13
00:00:26,249 --> 00:00:27,922
You know how many people
own cards, Jake?

14
00:00:27,946 --> 00:00:28,947
Then explain this.

15
00:00:28,971 --> 00:00:31,385
Johnny Franzia's catchphrase
is "deuces are wild."

16
00:00:31,409 --> 00:00:32,631
Now look around the apartment.

17
00:00:32,655 --> 00:00:35,175
Two chairs, two paintings, two pillows.

18
00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:36,200
There are three lamps.

19
00:00:36,224 --> 00:00:37,799
You think Franzia
gives a damn about lamps?

20
00:00:37,823 --> 00:00:39,370
You sound so dumb right now.

21
00:00:39,394 --> 00:00:40,889
This is why you don't have
an arch nemesis, Terry,

22
00:00:40,913 --> 00:00:42,725
because you focus
on all the wrong details.

23
00:00:42,749 --> 00:00:44,184
Maybe I don't have an arch nemesis

24
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:46,654
because I solve all my crimes.

25
00:00:53,226 --> 00:00:55,028
That's a pretty [bleep]-up
thing to say to me.

26
00:01:11,796 --> 00:01:13,796
<font color="#741b47">Sync & corrections by </font><font color="#ead1dc">emeline-whovian</font>
<font color="#741b47">www.addic7ed.com</font>

27
00:01:15,135 --> 00:01:16,312
<i>You wanted to see us, Captain?</i>

28
00:01:16,336 --> 00:01:17,747
I'm giving the murder to someone else.

29
00:01:17,771 --> 00:01:18,615
What?

30
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:20,512
You' taking me off the Franzia case?

31
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:23,359
My God, he got to you, didn't he?

32
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,823
I assure you, he did not.

33
00:01:24,847 --> 00:01:26,596
I had never heard
of Johnny Franzia before today.

34
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,452
Well, it was mostly before you arrived.

35
00:01:28,476 --> 00:01:30,400
Actually, you're entire first year here

36
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:31,830
I was convinced you were Franzia,

37
00:01:31,854 --> 00:01:34,737
which I now realize
is completely ridiculous.

38
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:35,672
Or is it?

39
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,753
I have no investment in this backstory.

40
00:01:37,777 --> 00:01:39,042
- Right.
- I'm taking you off the case

41
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:40,176
because you both asked

42
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,216
for reduced hours
to focus on childcare,

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,385
and Santiago has
her big presentation this week.

44
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:46,015
If our pilot program to reimagine

45
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,622
how uniformed officers
are deployed gets funded,

46
00:01:48,646 --> 00:01:51,522
it will represent a significant
reform for the NYPD.

47
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:54,294
Sir, we can take care of Mac
and still do both of our jobs.

48
00:01:54,318 --> 00:01:56,366
Trust me, we've got this whole
parenting thing figured out.

49
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,161
It's true.
We're great, and Mac is great.

50
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:00,864
I mean, the only teeny-tiny issue

51
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:02,400
is that he isn't
pulling himself up yet,

52
00:02:02,425 --> 00:02:04,036
but the window for that
is 9 to 12 months.

53
00:02:04,061 --> 00:02:05,939
So the fact that he's 10 months
old and isn't doing it yet

54
00:02:05,964 --> 00:02:07,269
doesn't mean that we're bad parents.

55
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,993
- _
- And I was reading that Simone Biles

56
00:02:10,017 --> 00:02:11,975
went straight from crawling to walking.

57
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:13,743
So, yeah, I guess
I should be "concerned"

58
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:15,211
that my son is on the same track

59
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,913
as a multiple gold medal winner.

60
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:18,359
I mean, get real, sir.

61
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:23,586
So, yeah, Mac's having
a little trouble pulling up,

62
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,034
but did that convince you
to give us more responsibility?

63
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:28,023
Look, if you promise you can handle it,

64
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,733
I'll put you back
on the John Franzo case.

65
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,124
Franzia. Johnny Franzia.

66
00:02:32,148 --> 00:02:35,226
How could you forget that? Unless...

67
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:36,362
- Get out.
- You got it.

68
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,230
<i>Thank you for letting me
stay with you, Diaz.</i>

69
00:02:38,254 --> 00:02:39,982
I am sorry for imposing.

70
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:42,067
I assumed I'd be back
with Kevin by now.

71
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:43,706
Oh, couple's therapy isn't going well?

72
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,572
Well, we're not back together,

73
00:02:46,596 --> 00:02:48,274
even after three full sessions.

74
00:02:48,298 --> 00:02:49,809
That's three hours,

75
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,285
more if you include travel time.

76
00:02:51,309 --> 00:02:52,798
Why would I include travel time?

77
00:02:52,836 --> 00:02:54,514
It's a longer drive for me
than for Kevin,

78
00:02:54,538 --> 00:02:56,272
so I'm putting in more effort.

79
00:02:56,297 --> 00:02:58,084
Hmm, I wonder why it's not going well.

80
00:02:58,108 --> 00:03:00,687
Well, Kevin says it's because
so all I care about is work.t.

81
00:03:00,711 --> 00:03:02,855
But if that's true,
why did I leave work

82
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,891
13 minutes early today
to move in with you?

83
00:03:04,915 --> 00:03:06,836
Well, you can stay as long as you like.

84
00:03:06,861 --> 00:03:08,801
You're quiet, you're neat.
You're the perfect roommate.

85
00:03:08,826 --> 00:03:10,023
I think Kevin would disagree.

86
00:03:10,048 --> 00:03:12,984
He told Dr. Cheryl
I'm a sore loser at Scrabble.

87
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:15,946
How would he know that
when I win 78% of our matches?

88
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:18,504
Wow, you're a lot chattier
than I remember you being.

89
00:03:18,528 --> 00:03:19,605
Oh, sorry. I promise...

90
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:22,048
I won't obsess about Kevin
the whole time I'm here.

91
00:03:22,073 --> 00:03:23,384
Okay. Great.

92
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,417
Although I may break that promise,

93
00:03:25,442 --> 00:03:27,211
because according to Kevin, I'm a liar.

94
00:03:27,362 --> 00:03:29,640
Ah, damn it, two of clubs is blank.

95
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,098
That's not like him.
So what are we missing here?

96
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:34,384
Two chairs, two paintings.

97
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:36,111
Oh, my God, the lamps.

98
00:03:36,136 --> 00:03:38,218
But you told Terry that
Franzia didn't care about lamps.

99
00:03:38,242 --> 00:03:39,286
No, he loves lamps.

100
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:41,053
I was just feeling attacked,
so I lashed out,

101
00:03:41,078 --> 00:03:43,603
but why three identical lamps
instead of two?

102
00:03:43,776 --> 00:03:45,354
Because they're not actually identical.

103
00:03:45,483 --> 00:03:47,814
The shade on this one is darker, and...

104
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,150
- Ooh!
- It's a blacklight.

105
00:03:50,274 --> 00:03:51,818
Yes, frickin' two of clubs.

106
00:03:51,843 --> 00:03:53,332
Turn off the overheads.

107
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,730
Franzia!

108
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,510
Hey, so don't freak out,

109
00:03:59,535 --> 00:04:02,141
but apparently there
are several other groups

110
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:05,012
presenting reform proposals
to One Police Plaza,

111
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,458
and only one will get funding.

112
00:04:06,516 --> 00:04:07,960
Why would that make me freak out?

113
00:04:07,985 --> 00:04:09,897
Because you can be
a little competitive.

114
00:04:09,922 --> 00:04:11,187
That's not true.

115
00:04:11,212 --> 00:04:13,324
No one is less competitive than me.

116
00:04:13,896 --> 00:04:14,988
No one.

117
00:04:15,012 --> 00:04:17,679
Anyway, uh, here's
who you're up against.

118
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:19,493
Alan Peters. Dud.

119
00:04:19,517 --> 00:04:20,661
Mike Lynch. Dud.

120
00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:22,062
Tad Green. Dud!

121
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:24,243
Austin Grant.

122
00:04:24,268 --> 00:04:25,866
Who's Austin Grant? Not a dud?

123
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,801
Oh, he's a dud, but he's a hot dud.

124
00:04:27,825 --> 00:04:28,969
He's a "hud."

125
00:04:28,993 --> 00:04:30,537
He gets everything handed to him

126
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,872
because he looks so good in a uniform.

127
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,318
Ugh, and he's pitching

128
00:04:33,343 --> 00:04:35,341
predictive algorithmic policing.

129
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:37,110
That's just high-tech racial profiling.

130
00:04:37,134 --> 00:04:40,647
Okay, look, if this guy
is style over substance,

131
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:43,550
we just need to give you some style.

132
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,805
Check this out.

133
00:04:46,344 --> 00:04:49,690
Tiny Terry won the
Little Mister Michigan pageant.

134
00:04:49,714 --> 00:04:51,091
You just happen to have
a video of yourself

135
00:04:51,115 --> 00:04:52,526
as a seven-year-old on your phone?

136
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,339
Big Terry's proud of Tiny Terry.

137
00:04:54,388 --> 00:04:56,299
Look, the point is, I can help you.

138
00:04:56,324 --> 00:04:57,384
Terry! Terry!

139
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:58,986
It's him. It's really Franzia.

140
00:04:59,011 --> 00:04:59,970
Don't ask how I know

141
00:04:59,995 --> 00:05:01,614
'cause it has nothing to do with lamps.

142
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,515
Jake, what are you doing here?

143
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,380
What are you doing here?

144
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:06,643
You're supposed to be
getting Mac from day care!

145
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,411
<i>He's finally down.</i>

146
00:05:11,435 --> 00:05:13,480
Did you miss anything important
with your case?

147
00:05:13,504 --> 00:05:15,485
Yes, because jokers are wild,

148
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,355
Charles went to the "Joker"
stairs, and there was graffiti

149
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,197
of the victim's name
written on a bus stop.

150
00:05:19,222 --> 00:05:21,120
So Charles got on the bus,
took it to the end of the line,

151
00:05:21,145 --> 00:05:22,322
where there was a payphone ringing.

152
00:05:22,346 --> 00:05:23,892
He picked it up, and there
was a voice on the other end

153
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:24,917
that told him a riddle.

154
00:05:24,942 --> 00:05:25,796
- What was the riddle?
- I don't know.

155
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:27,632
He had to go before he could
tell me because he noticed

156
00:05:27,657 --> 00:05:29,334
that his kitchen window
was mysteriously unlocked.

157
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:31,409
Stupid Franzia is probably
in his house right now

158
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:32,874
trying to murder him and his family.

159
00:05:32,903 --> 00:05:34,793
At least he's not here
trying to murder me and Mac.

160
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:36,365
I appreciate you trying
to make me feel better, Ames,

161
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,924
but we both know
you're grasping at straws.

162
00:05:39,843 --> 00:05:41,190
Thank God.

163
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,010
Charles is fine. Nobody in the house.

164
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:44,911
I would have been so jealous.

165
00:05:44,935 --> 00:05:46,141
I'm sorry, babe.

166
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,910
I'd say I'd take over Mac stuff
for the week,

167
00:05:47,935 --> 00:05:50,495
but I have to rewrite my whole
presentation to be snappier,

168
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,966
and, also, according to Terry,
I need to learn

169
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:55,233
how to walk with my shoulders
and not my feet.

170
00:05:55,258 --> 00:05:57,469
It's okay. What you're doing
is super important.

171
00:05:57,494 --> 00:05:58,772
I'll just scale back

172
00:05:58,797 --> 00:06:00,572
and let Charles run point
on the Franzia case.

173
00:06:00,597 --> 00:06:02,949
No. None of us are scaling back.

174
00:06:02,974 --> 00:06:05,419
We can be good parents without
sacrificing our careers.

175
00:06:05,452 --> 00:06:06,696
We just have to work as a team.

176
00:06:06,721 --> 00:06:07,932
You know what? Yes, you're right.

177
00:06:07,957 --> 00:06:09,401
We got this.

178
00:06:09,426 --> 00:06:10,670
All we need is each other.

179
00:06:10,695 --> 00:06:11,972
There's been a lice outbreak
at day care,

180
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,602
and they're closing
for the next two days.

181
00:06:13,627 --> 00:06:15,062
What? No!

182
00:06:15,087 --> 00:06:17,130
We need so much more than each other.

183
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:19,336
Ugh, damn it.

184
00:06:19,361 --> 00:06:21,387
None of our regular babysitters
are available.

185
00:06:21,412 --> 00:06:23,696
And my parents are out of town,
and my brother David can't help

186
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:25,031
because he's in Sudan digging wells

187
00:06:25,056 --> 00:06:26,834
for somebody or something...
I don't know, I hung up on him.

188
00:06:26,859 --> 00:06:28,170
My dad's out, too.

189
00:06:28,452 --> 00:06:30,058
That's all he said,
didn't give a reason.

190
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,434
Wait, I've got it.

191
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:32,853
Let's just let Mac watch TV all day.

192
00:06:32,878 --> 00:06:34,033
Jake, we've talked about this.

193
00:06:34,057 --> 00:06:36,646
No screen time for Mac
until he turns two.

194
00:06:36,671 --> 00:06:37,774
Ugh.

195
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:39,439
All this stress is making my head itch.

196
00:06:39,463 --> 00:06:41,319
Yeah, it's weird... I've
actually been itching myself.

197
00:06:41,344 --> 00:06:43,242
No! Lice! Scratching it makes it worse.

198
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:44,410
- Is that true?
- I don't know.

199
00:06:44,435 --> 00:06:45,740
We don't have time to know what's true.

200
00:06:45,765 --> 00:06:47,209
Okay, okay, let's just stay calm.

201
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,308
When I had lice in the fifth grade,

202
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,931
my mom put a bunch
of maple syrup in my hair,

203
00:06:49,956 --> 00:06:51,911
and it smothered them to death,
it was actually kind of cool.

204
00:06:51,936 --> 00:06:53,119
You can hear their tiny screams.

205
00:06:53,143 --> 00:06:54,721
No, that's an old home remedy,

206
00:06:54,745 --> 00:06:56,556
and day care actually recommends

207
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,891
a place where you go, and they
comb the lice out for you.

208
00:06:58,915 --> 00:07:00,927
I bet we'll be in and out
in 20 minutes.

209
00:07:00,964 --> 00:07:03,467
Six hours? Who has that kind of time?

210
00:07:05,131 --> 00:07:07,109
So now what?

211
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:10,557
I mean, I guess
there is one last option.

212
00:07:10,582 --> 00:07:12,242
- Please don't say it.
- It worked for me in fifth grade.

213
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:13,472
I really don't want to.

214
00:07:13,496 --> 00:07:14,558
It is kind of cool
to hear the screaming.

215
00:07:14,597 --> 00:07:15,941
Okay, fine, we'll do the syrup.

216
00:07:15,965 --> 00:07:17,176
We're gonna do the syrup!

217
00:07:21,871 --> 00:07:23,949
<i>♪ Come on</i>

218
00:07:23,973 --> 00:07:25,484
<i>♪ Oh</i>

219
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:29,054
Oh, Amy, what is that
enchanting new perfume?

220
00:07:29,078 --> 00:07:30,856
It's syrup, Scully.

221
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,402
And it is working. Hmm-hmm.

222
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:37,634
I think you just made Scully horny.

223
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:38,769
Ugh.

224
00:07:38,794 --> 00:07:40,132
<i>And then he called her Cheryl,</i>

225
00:07:40,156 --> 00:07:41,814
not Dr. Cheryl,

226
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,882
a clear attempt to delegitimize her.

227
00:07:43,906 --> 00:07:46,552
Obviously, I agree,
she has zero legitimacy.

228
00:07:46,577 --> 00:07:48,345
I mean, she calls herself Dr. Cheryl.

229
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,149
Then Kevin brings up how
Cheddar's French comprehension

230
00:07:51,174 --> 00:07:52,391
has regressed.

231
00:07:52,415 --> 00:07:53,659
Cheddar's tutor says

232
00:07:53,683 --> 00:07:55,269
it's because we're not
speaking enough at home.

233
00:07:55,294 --> 00:07:57,646
The worst part
is we used to share socks.

234
00:07:57,671 --> 00:08:00,164
With an odd number,
that was a tense negotiation.

235
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:01,275
Enough!

236
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,302
All you do is talk about Kevin.
This needs to stop.

237
00:08:04,327 --> 00:08:06,204
I'm sorry...
I wish I could stop thinking

238
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:08,490
about him, but he was
my husband for 20 years.

239
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:11,944
If you know how I could just
erase him from my memory,

240
00:08:11,968 --> 00:08:13,289
I'd love to hear it.

241
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:14,789
We could get really drunk.

242
00:08:16,105 --> 00:08:17,332
Yes, let's try that.

243
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,169
Jake, Jake, Franzia was in my house.

244
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:21,553
I didn't see anything last night,

245
00:08:21,577 --> 00:08:22,846
but when I showered this morning,

246
00:08:22,871 --> 00:08:24,789
a new riddle appeared
in the steam on the mirror.

247
00:08:24,814 --> 00:08:26,758
Oh, cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool.

248
00:08:26,782 --> 00:08:28,293
I also saw a riddle while showering.

249
00:08:28,317 --> 00:08:29,803
But we didn't shower this morning.

250
00:08:29,852 --> 00:08:31,363
No, I know, it's just Charles
and I have this agreement

251
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:32,731
that when I miss something
important on the case,

252
00:08:32,755 --> 00:08:34,933
he pretends like I'm still
involved... it's normal.

253
00:08:34,991 --> 00:08:37,336
Anyways, I'm sure our shower
riddles were the same.

254
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,896
No, I'm sure yours was better.

255
00:08:38,921 --> 00:08:40,332
Well, just to be sure,
why don't you text me yours,

256
00:08:40,357 --> 00:08:41,567
and I'll make sure
it's the same as mine,

257
00:08:41,592 --> 00:08:42,469
and then we can decode it together

258
00:08:42,494 --> 00:08:44,401
- after Ames and I find a sitter.
- Great.

259
00:08:44,426 --> 00:08:45,961
Ooh, we already have three applicants.

260
00:08:45,986 --> 00:08:47,112
Great. Hire them.

261
00:08:47,137 --> 00:08:48,380
I think we should interview them first.

262
00:08:48,405 --> 00:08:50,032
But what if they're bad?

263
00:08:50,057 --> 00:08:51,325
This really feels like fate

264
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,195
because I was arrested in this precinct

265
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,120
literally a year ago to the day.

266
00:08:55,145 --> 00:08:57,957
Here, I brought a toy
for the little guy.

267
00:08:57,998 --> 00:08:59,680
Oh, thanks. That's very nice of you.

268
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,692
He's so soft.

269
00:09:00,716 --> 00:09:03,253
Your son's really gonna
enjoy cuddling him.

270
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:05,556
Want to see me cuddle him?
I love cuddling.

271
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:07,300
Well, this went south very quickly.

272
00:09:07,325 --> 00:09:09,136
I consider myself
a bit of a Mary Poppins.

273
00:09:09,218 --> 00:09:10,594
Oh, how so?

274
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:14,265
♪ I'm your nanny,
I'll slap your fanny ♪

275
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,766
♪ Slap, slap, slap

276
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,769
♪ Your fat little fanny

277
00:09:17,867 --> 00:09:19,311
Yeah, it's gonna be a no.

278
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:21,380
I got to get back to Franzia,

279
00:09:21,404 --> 00:09:24,149
so feels like we should go
with the cuddler.

280
00:09:24,173 --> 00:09:26,151
No, as much as I want to work,

281
00:09:26,175 --> 00:09:27,861
we can't leave our son
with some weirdo.

282
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:30,197
Maybe we ask someone in the precinct?

283
00:09:30,222 --> 00:09:31,358
Everyone's working.

284
00:09:33,457 --> 00:09:34,893
Not everyone.

285
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:36,028
Sure, I'll watch Mac.

286
00:09:36,052 --> 00:09:38,697
Don't worry, I've padded
all the sharp edges in here.

287
00:09:38,721 --> 00:09:40,132
Wow. You already baby-proofed it?

288
00:09:40,156 --> 00:09:41,500
Ah, it's my nap room.

289
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:43,185
You can take a nap anywhere in here.

290
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,803
Every surface is like a bed.

291
00:09:44,836 --> 00:09:46,682
- Huh.
- Works for us.

292
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:49,608
Okay. Sorry, the babysitter
thing took a little longer

293
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:50,675
than I was expecting,

294
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:52,052
but I solved part of the riddle.

295
00:09:52,077 --> 00:09:53,287
A cat has ten lives.

296
00:09:53,312 --> 00:09:55,257
I think the lives are numbers.

297
00:09:55,296 --> 00:09:56,640
Wow, that's so smart.

298
00:09:56,738 --> 00:09:58,816
I already solved the riddle.
It's a phone number.

299
00:09:58,841 --> 00:10:00,485
But you're here now.
We can call together.

300
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:01,724
Okay, yeah, I guess.

301
00:10:01,749 --> 00:10:02,753
I mean, maybe he'll have

302
00:10:02,778 --> 00:10:04,398
a cool scary modulated voice
or something.

303
00:10:04,423 --> 00:10:06,358
- Yeah, yeah.
- All right.

304
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,894
<i>Hello.</i>

305
00:10:08,918 --> 00:10:09,828
Oh, my God, he does.

306
00:10:09,852 --> 00:10:11,989
<i>You solved my riddle, Detective Boyle.</i>

307
00:10:12,014 --> 00:10:13,323
And Detective Peralta!

308
00:10:13,348 --> 00:10:16,050
I'm still on your tail,
and your sick game is finally...

309
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:17,619
Help! Help!

310
00:10:17,644 --> 00:10:18,602
Oh, seriously?

311
00:10:18,627 --> 00:10:21,039
Uh, Franzia, I got to go real quick.

312
00:10:21,063 --> 00:10:22,507
<i>What? You have to go?</i>

313
00:10:22,531 --> 00:10:24,709
Boyle will explain,
but I'm still on your tail.

314
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:26,211
And if you think
the jokers are really wild...

315
00:10:26,235 --> 00:10:27,379
Jake!

316
00:10:27,403 --> 00:10:28,914
All right, I'm coming! Damn it!

317
00:10:28,938 --> 00:10:30,082
Jake!

318
00:10:30,106 --> 00:10:31,383
- What happened?
- Is Mac okay?

319
00:10:31,407 --> 00:10:32,901
Mac's fine. It's me.

320
00:10:32,926 --> 00:10:36,113
There was one unpadded corner,
and I stubbed my toe real bad.

321
00:10:36,138 --> 00:10:37,014
Look.

322
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,416
- Ugh!
- Oh, God!

323
00:10:38,441 --> 00:10:40,686
I'm sorry, I got to go to the hospital.

324
00:10:40,726 --> 00:10:42,978
Yeah, immediately, for so many reasons.

325
00:10:43,003 --> 00:10:44,595
- Come on.
- Gosh.

326
00:10:46,606 --> 00:10:47,666
Is he okay?

327
00:10:47,691 --> 00:10:48,800
He's fine.

328
00:10:48,825 --> 00:10:50,836
Ames, I'm sorry, but I think
we're all out of babysitters.

329
00:10:50,986 --> 00:10:54,672
No. There is one option left.

330
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:56,775
His first screen time, this is amazing.

331
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,844
Which "Transformers" movie
should he watch first?

332
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:00,245
There's an argument
to be made for "Bumblebee,"

333
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:01,246
as it is a prequel.

334
00:11:01,271 --> 00:11:02,331
- Jake.
- All right, fine.

335
00:11:02,356 --> 00:11:04,334
Just let it auto-play whatever
garbage it wants, and let's go.

336
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:07,119
Okay. Here you go, Mac.

337
00:11:07,143 --> 00:11:08,453
Here you go.

338
00:11:14,283 --> 00:11:15,568
Yeah, we deserve that.

339
00:11:15,927 --> 00:11:17,859
Oh, I am hungover. How you feeling?

340
00:11:17,884 --> 00:11:18,959
Not good at all.

341
00:11:18,984 --> 00:11:20,544
You were supposed
to watch out for me, Diaz.

342
00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:22,159
Good news is,
the heavy drinking worked.

343
00:11:22,184 --> 00:11:23,994
You didn't mention Kevin one time.

344
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:25,562
Oh, that is an accomplishment.

345
00:11:25,594 --> 00:11:27,973
Unfortunately, it appears

346
00:11:27,997 --> 00:11:30,817
that I did think about him
at least once last night.

347
00:11:30,842 --> 00:11:32,569
What do you mean?

348
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:34,219
At 3:30 a.m.,
I seem to have sent Kevin...

349
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:38,784
A digital phallus portrait.

350
00:11:38,841 --> 00:11:40,852
A digital phallus portrait?
What is that?

351
00:11:40,876 --> 00:11:42,746
[gasps] Oh, no, you sent him
a [bleep] pic.

352
00:11:45,915 --> 00:11:47,559
Shh. Shh.

353
00:11:47,584 --> 00:11:49,345
Please stop crying. I'm so tired.

354
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,981
Maybe we'd all be better rested

355
00:11:51,006 --> 00:11:52,617
if we hadn't woken up at 3:00 a.m.

356
00:11:52,642 --> 00:11:54,505
I'm sorry, I've never slept
with syrup in my hair before.

357
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:56,103
I didn't know that was gonna happen.

358
00:11:56,194 --> 00:11:57,628
Ants! Ants in the bed!

359
00:11:57,662 --> 00:11:59,464
- Who?
- There's ants in the bed!

360
00:11:59,488 --> 00:12:00,990
There's ants! There's ants!

361
00:12:01,102 --> 00:12:02,513
My presentation is today,

362
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:04,717
and I am not showing up
in a shower cap.

363
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,818
What are we gonna do?

364
00:12:06,842 --> 00:12:08,102
There's only one thing left to do.

365
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:11,481
We're gonna blow-dry these sons
of bitches straight to hell.

366
00:12:11,506 --> 00:12:12,523
_

367
00:12:12,547 --> 00:12:14,067
Got to say, worked great.

368
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:17,095
Although I guess my hair took
it a little better than yours.

369
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:18,663
And why the glasses?

370
00:12:18,687 --> 00:12:20,098
Mac knocked my last contacts
into the toilet

371
00:12:20,122 --> 00:12:21,324
while I was blow-drying.

372
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:22,967
Got to hand it to him,
it's a solid prank.

373
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,002
Although I must say,
this look kind of works for you.

374
00:12:25,026 --> 00:12:26,771
Jake, we don't have time
for your nerd fetish.

375
00:12:26,795 --> 00:12:27,972
We are so late.

376
00:12:27,996 --> 00:12:29,474
I know. You know what?

377
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,309
Let's not waste any more time
looking for babysitters.

378
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,627
We'll just take Mac into work with us.

379
00:12:32,888 --> 00:12:34,398
See, Ames, we got this.

380
00:12:34,423 --> 00:12:35,812
Yeah, this is not gonna be hard.

381
00:12:35,837 --> 00:12:38,017
You want to know why?
'Cause we're great parents.

382
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:40,521
In fact, we forgot Mac.
We left our child inside.

383
00:12:40,546 --> 00:12:42,053
- Oh.
- Uh, get the keys.

384
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:43,689
Okay, I'll take Mac first

385
00:12:43,714 --> 00:12:45,489
so you can start practicing
your presentation.

386
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:46,724
- Okay.
- Jake, I think

387
00:12:46,748 --> 00:12:48,142
I figured something out
about the toolbox.

388
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,045
- Toolbox?
- Franzia sent me a toolbox.

389
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,808
It turned out to be a puzzle.
It was so boring.

390
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,012
Charles, it wasn't boring.
I know what you're doing.

391
00:12:55,037 --> 00:12:57,335
- Just tell me what happened.
- Okay, so I ran it for prints.

392
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,695
And there was a partial on the wrench.

393
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,364
It belongs to a guy named Eric Marsh

394
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:02,715
who works as a handyman
in the victim's building.

395
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,342
- We have to bring him in.
- Already done.

396
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,877
He's in interrogation right now,

397
00:13:05,901 --> 00:13:07,845
- just waiting for you.
- Oh...

398
00:13:07,869 --> 00:13:09,622
But I have Mac for the next hour.

399
00:13:09,647 --> 00:13:11,625
I can't run an interrogation.

400
00:13:12,231 --> 00:13:13,393
Unless...

401
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,829
How did your prints end up on a wrench

402
00:13:14,854 --> 00:13:16,332
that was sent to this police station?

403
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,023
That wrench went missing two weeks ago.

404
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,759
I thought someone took it
out of the back of my truck.

405
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,551
Of course, that sounds...

406
00:13:21,576 --> 00:13:23,054
Totally reasonable, Eric.

407
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,938
Or should I call you by your real name?

408
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,431
Johnny Franzia.

409
00:13:26,456 --> 00:13:27,533
I don't know who that is.

410
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:29,837
Uh-oh. Something stinks.

411
00:13:29,971 --> 00:13:32,395
Something stinks real bad.

412
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,788
- Did you poop?
- No.

413
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,107
You did. You pooped.

414
00:13:36,132 --> 00:13:38,143
Oh, God, it's everywhere.

415
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,669
What did you eat, buddy?

416
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,105
Today? I had some oatmeal.

417
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,280
Here's what's gonna happen.

418
00:13:42,305 --> 00:13:45,715
I'm gonna lie you down,
I'm gonna take your pants off,

419
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,552
and I'm gonna wipe your little tushy.

420
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:48,486
What is going on?

421
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,787
I actually have the same question.

422
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:51,534
Hold on one second. Jake?

423
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,950
Why did I send Kevin
an obscene picture?

424
00:13:53,975 --> 00:13:55,476
Relax. It's not a big deal.

425
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,761
You were just flirting.

426
00:13:56,785 --> 00:13:58,930
No, if I were flirting,
I would have sent him

427
00:13:58,954 --> 00:14:01,190
a scatter plot
of educational attainment

428
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,593
versus caloric intake
in Jacobin France.

429
00:14:03,618 --> 00:14:07,613
This is as if I've sent him
a bar graph.

430
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:08,706
Are bar graphs bad?

431
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,086
It reduces robust data sets
to a single point.

432
00:14:11,111 --> 00:14:12,422
Get your head out of your ass!

433
00:14:12,801 --> 00:14:15,546
I'm sorry... I'm just panicking,

434
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,381
thinking about what Kevin
will do when he sees it.

435
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,716
Wait, you don't think he's seen it yet?

436
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,195
No, Kevin only checks his email

437
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,664
once a day at exactly 4:00 p.m.

438
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,439
- You didn't text it to him?
- We're not teens.

439
00:14:23,464 --> 00:14:25,715
Let's delete it off his computer, then.

440
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,491
Yes, that could work.

441
00:14:26,516 --> 00:14:29,027
Kevin has virtual office hours
at 2:00 p.m.

442
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,439
<i>At the same time, Cheddar
will be taking a French lesson</i>

443
00:14:31,464 --> 00:14:33,122
<i>with his tutor, Monsieur Arnaud.</i>

444
00:14:33,147 --> 00:14:35,291
<i>We only have one hour</i> exactement.

445
00:14:35,316 --> 00:14:37,461
- Here is Kevin's laptop.
- Great.

446
00:14:37,486 --> 00:14:39,197
"Dear Kevin, attached please
find a picture of my penis.

447
00:14:39,222 --> 00:14:41,798
Sincerely, Raymond Holt." Deleted.

448
00:14:43,074 --> 00:14:45,026
Cheddar! <i>Non, s'il vous plait, non.</i>

449
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,529
French class must have ended early.

450
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:47,831
- Shut up.
- Shh.

451
00:14:47,856 --> 00:14:49,597

Amy, we got to talk.

480
00:15:56,814 --> 00:15:58,792
I just got a call
from One Police Plaza.

481
00:15:58,817 --> 00:16:00,626
They said they were trying
to reach you all morning.

482
00:16:00,651 --> 00:16:02,436
Mac broke my phone. What do they want?

483
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,972
They moved your presentation up.

484
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:05,006
You're on in 20 minutes!

485
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,507
- 20 minutes?
- Amy!

486
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,593
We know where Franzia is.
We're gonna go arrest him.

487
00:16:08,618 --> 00:16:09,677
I need you to take Mac.

488
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,747
No, you need to take Mac!
I have to go right now.

489
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:13,890
So do I! What do we do?

490
00:16:13,915 --> 00:16:15,492
I guess we could call
that creepy babysitter

491
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:18,102
- you liked so much.
- The babysitter is Franzia!

492
00:16:18,127 --> 00:16:19,905
Even better! Two birds with one stone!

493
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:20,855
We bring him to you!

494
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,065
We're not giving our baby
to a serial killer!

495
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,124
- Oh, grow up!
- Come on!

496
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,987
Amy, if we miss this presentation,

497
00:16:28,012 --> 00:16:29,616
that's the end of the pilot program!

498
00:16:29,641 --> 00:16:32,366
Jake, SWAT is on their way.
We have to go to Franzia's now.

499
00:16:32,394 --> 00:16:34,913
This is our best chance
at police reform!

500
00:16:34,938 --> 00:16:38,518
- Franzia, Lieutenant, Franzia!
- Reform, Boyle, Reform!

501
00:16:38,543 --> 00:16:39,582
Okay, enough!

502
00:16:39,743 --> 00:16:42,889
Charles is right.
Jake has waited years for this.

503
00:16:42,914 --> 00:16:44,659
No, he can make the arrest without me.

504
00:16:44,684 --> 00:16:46,395
Without you, there is no presentation.

505
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,627
I'll take Mac.

506
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:51,340
- Are you sure?
- Yes, absolutely.

507
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:54,545
All right, now go.
Everyone, get out of here.

508
00:16:54,569 --> 00:16:55,712
Come on.

509
00:16:55,736 --> 00:16:57,859
- I love you.
- Love you.

510
00:17:03,672 --> 00:17:05,216
Oh, crap, there's Austin.

511
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:06,980
Oh, damn, he is a "hud."

512
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:09,350
Okay, okay. Let's just be cool.

513
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,383
- Yeah.
- Here, hold my glasses.

514
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:14,664
Hey, Austin, long time no... mm, see.

515
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:16,433
Santiago, are you okay?

516
00:17:16,457 --> 00:17:19,736
Yeah, great. You look good.

517
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,920
Thanks, I know, and you have
a very brave hairstyle?

518
00:17:22,945 --> 00:17:23,796
Thank you.

519
00:17:23,821 --> 00:17:25,370
Sergeant Santiago, we're ready for you.

520
00:17:27,301 --> 00:17:29,546
I look insane. What am I gonna do?

521
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,170
Okay, style over substance
is clearly out,

522
00:17:32,195 --> 00:17:34,640
but if anyone can substance
the crap out of this,

523
00:17:34,665 --> 00:17:36,209
it's Amy Santiago.

524
00:17:36,234 --> 00:17:39,714
You're right, I can do this.
Substance over style.

525
00:17:39,739 --> 00:17:41,430
Mm!

526
00:17:41,749 --> 00:17:43,210
Come on, Amy.

527
00:17:44,948 --> 00:17:45,686
Hello?

528
00:17:46,246 --> 00:17:48,257
Raymond, what are you doing here?

529
00:17:48,282 --> 00:17:49,453
Kevin, I didn't know you were home.

530
00:17:49,478 --> 00:17:50,553
I came by to get a book.

531
00:17:50,578 --> 00:17:54,470
"The History of The Crusades:
Volume Three, 1123 to 1137."

532
00:17:54,495 --> 00:17:56,773
- Why did you need it?
- I had an urgent question.

533
00:17:56,797 --> 00:17:58,030
- About what?
- The atabeg of Mosul.

534
00:17:58,055 --> 00:17:59,065
- Jikirmish?
- Zengi.

535
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,633
But you already know
everything about Zengi.

536
00:18:00,658 --> 00:18:03,237
True, it was Diaz's question, um...

537
00:18:03,812 --> 00:18:05,790
and I was embarrassed for her.

538
00:18:05,815 --> 00:18:07,212
And what was your question, Diaz?

539
00:18:08,816 --> 00:18:10,994
I wanted to know who Zengi is.

540
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:12,340
Yes, that is embarrassing.

541
00:18:12,365 --> 00:18:14,526
I can see why you tried
to cover for her.

542
00:18:14,686 --> 00:18:15,930
Well, if that's all...

543
00:18:15,955 --> 00:18:18,443
It is. Uh, just Zengi.

544
00:18:19,386 --> 00:18:20,831
Just Zengi.

545
00:18:22,256 --> 00:18:24,471
All right, then. Goodbye.

546
00:18:29,335 --> 00:18:30,900
- How'd it go?
- Good!

547
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:33,400
They liked the thesis,
and I was clear on the data.

548
00:18:33,425 --> 00:18:35,536
Just one problem...
I realized halfway through

549
00:18:35,561 --> 00:18:36,857
that these sweatpants

550
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,260
are from a bachelorette party
I went to,

551
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:40,780
and they say WAP on the butt.

552
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:43,410
I told them it stands
for "We All Police."

553
00:18:43,711 --> 00:18:47,024
- Hey, wish me luck in there.
- Did your teeth get whiter?

554
00:18:47,048 --> 00:18:48,025
That's an illusion.

555
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:49,210
My smile is so symmetrical,

556
00:18:49,235 --> 00:18:50,710
it makes my teeth seem brighter.

557
00:18:50,735 --> 00:18:52,913
Well, good luck. Oops.

558
00:18:52,938 --> 00:18:54,415
What the hell?

559
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,971
Austin, we're...

560
00:18:56,579 --> 00:18:58,090
Everything okay?

561
00:18:58,115 --> 00:19:00,499
- He peed himself.
- No.

562
00:19:02,196 --> 00:19:04,007
That's funny... same thing happened

563
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:06,309
to Alex Nelson
at Little Mister Michigan.

564
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,146
What?

565
00:19:07,171 --> 00:19:09,315
Tiny Terry did what he had to do.

566
00:19:10,237 --> 00:19:11,481
So right as we get there,

567
00:19:11,505 --> 00:19:14,351
Franzia disappears into these
crazy underground tunnels.

568
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,086
So we have to switch over
to night vision...

569
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,188
Charles, it's all so awesome,

570
00:19:18,212 --> 00:19:20,657
but I actually have to stop you
because I got to go.

571
00:19:20,681 --> 00:19:23,560
I have to feed this baby
some mushed-up avocado...

572
00:19:23,584 --> 00:19:25,660
Oh, my God.

573
00:19:25,685 --> 00:19:27,330
What happened? Is Mac okay?

574
00:19:27,621 --> 00:19:30,318
He just pulled himself up.

575
00:19:34,113 --> 00:19:36,260
Hey, did Kevin seem weird
to you when we told him

576
00:19:36,285 --> 00:19:37,550
we were only there for that book?

577
00:19:37,575 --> 00:19:38,721
You think he didn't believe us?

578
00:19:38,746 --> 00:19:40,010
No, he seemed sad.

579
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:42,430
I think he was disappointed

580
00:19:42,455 --> 00:19:44,010
that you were there
for the book and not for him.

581
00:19:44,138 --> 00:19:46,197
Maybe you should let him know
you've been missing him.

582
00:19:46,222 --> 00:19:49,930
Huh, well, it might be worth a shot.

583
00:19:51,445 --> 00:19:53,824
- What did you just do?
- I texted him a picture

584
00:19:53,848 --> 00:19:55,025
of my penis, like you suggested.

585
00:19:55,049 --> 00:19:56,626
No. Ugh!

586
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,028
I meant for you to call him

587
00:19:58,052 --> 00:19:59,365
and tell him you've
been thinking about him.

588
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,537
- Why didn't you say that?
- I thought it was understood.

589
00:20:02,562 --> 00:20:04,073
Hold on. He's writing back.

590
00:20:04,425 --> 00:20:06,609
- Well, what did he say?
- It's a link to a graph.

591
00:20:07,094 --> 00:20:09,298
It's a scatter plot

592
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,713
with a very robust data set.

593
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,414
Well...

594
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,090
That escalated quickly.

595
00:20:15,141 --> 00:20:16,111
Hey.

596
00:20:16,136 --> 00:20:17,747
Hey, how'd the presentation go?

597
00:20:17,772 --> 00:20:20,180
Well, they just called, and...

598
00:20:20,546 --> 00:20:22,390
- I won.
- What?

599
00:20:22,415 --> 00:20:24,365
I have authorization
to start immediately.

600
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,060
Wait, you won? That's amazing.

601
00:20:26,085 --> 00:20:28,535
Why aren't you more excited?
Why aren't you dork-dancing?

602
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,293
'Cause you had to miss your thing,

603
00:20:30,317 --> 00:20:31,394
and I didn't want to rub it in.

604
00:20:31,418 --> 00:20:33,440
So I celebrated in the hallway
before I walked in.

605
00:20:33,821 --> 00:20:35,365
Yes! Yeah!

606
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:36,610
Oh! Oh!

607
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:37,612
How'd it go here with Mac?

608
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:39,205
Fine. Mellow.

609
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,280
He pulled himself up.

610
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:41,616
Wait, what?

611
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:43,490
That's huge! He's in the window!

612
00:20:43,515 --> 00:20:45,620
Why are you downplaying this?

613
00:20:45,966 --> 00:20:47,310
Well, I just figured

614
00:20:47,334 --> 00:20:48,370
you would be bummed that you missed it.

615
00:20:48,395 --> 00:20:49,806
Ugh, this sucks.

616
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,275
You didn't get to arrest Franzia.

617
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,165
I didn't get to see Mac pull up.

618
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,130
I guess we really can't do it all.

619
00:20:55,155 --> 00:20:56,231
I don't know.

620
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:59,068
I mean, you got to do the work thing,

621
00:20:59,093 --> 00:21:00,704
and I got to do the parent thing.

622
00:21:00,729 --> 00:21:02,117
So...

623
00:21:02,142 --> 00:21:03,451
together...

624
00:21:04,111 --> 00:21:05,220
we did do it all.

625
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,316
Yeah, I guess you're right.

626
00:21:10,591 --> 00:21:14,271
- It still totally sucks, though.
- Yeah, I'm really bummed.

627
00:21:14,295 --> 00:21:15,600
Yeah. I'm gonna get ready for bed.

628
00:21:15,996 --> 00:21:19,061
Okay. You're gonna wake up Mac
and see if he'll pull up, aren't you?

629
00:21:19,086 --> 00:21:20,998
Obviously, he is not sleeping
until he does it again.

630
00:21:21,023 --> 00:21:22,467
All right, well, don't go without me,

631
00:21:22,492 --> 00:21:23,511
'cause I want to see it.

632
