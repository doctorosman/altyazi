1
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,470
Of course, we'll kneel.

2
00:00:06,495 --> 00:00:08,230
Was there ever even a question?

3
00:00:08,255 --> 00:00:09,698
These are yours.

4
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:12,880
Ah. Why do I get the
feeling this is good-bye?

5
00:00:12,905 --> 00:00:14,490
The palace is mine now.

6
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,325
So is the farmhouse. For you, that...

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,059
We'll take the machine shop.

8
00:00:20,293 --> 00:00:22,897
You need a mechanic to run
the reactor. She's your girl.

9
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,967
Besides, you wouldn't want
your favorite chess partner

10
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:27,110
to live in a tent, would you?

11
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,946
Fine. Go. Who's next?

12
00:00:30,256 --> 00:00:33,637
_

13
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:37,851
Kneel so that you can fight another day.

14
00:00:38,362 --> 00:00:40,239
Good. I still get to kill you.

15
00:00:44,907 --> 00:00:47,090
Convicts, Children of Gabriel,

16
00:00:47,115 --> 00:00:48,673
welcome to the new Sanctum.

17
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,263
Things have changed quickly,

18
00:00:50,288 --> 00:00:51,961
but the future is full of promise,

19
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:54,246
and to reap the benefits
of this bright, new day,

20
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:56,431
I ask only that you take a knee

21
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,433
to show your loyalty,

22
00:00:58,612 --> 00:01:00,833
a simple gesture that
binds you to a contract

23
00:01:00,858 --> 00:01:02,228
with a single rule...

24
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,221
If at any time you do anything

25
00:01:05,246 --> 00:01:07,699
that I deem disloyal,

26
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,527
you die.

27
00:01:13,242 --> 00:01:15,206
And if we refuse?

28
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,850
You die.

29
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:24,667
In that case,

30
00:01:24,897 --> 00:01:26,169
the killers and the thieves

31
00:01:26,194 --> 00:01:28,654
of Eligius exploration ship number 4

32
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,785
are at your service.

33
00:01:38,193 --> 00:01:39,726
Nelson.

34
00:01:41,094 --> 00:01:44,378
My name is Sachin.

35
00:01:45,645 --> 00:01:48,314
My people and I swore and oath.

36
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:51,259
Better to die free

37
00:01:52,132 --> 00:01:55,559
than worship at the feet of false gods.

38
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:59,119
I will not kneel

39
00:01:59,393 --> 00:02:01,788
tonight or ever.

40
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:10,018
Does this man speak for all of you?

41
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,217
Surely some here would prefer to live.

42
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:17,679
One small genuflection,
and life goes on,

43
00:02:17,807 --> 00:02:20,936
one Sanctum under me
for the benefit of all.

44
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,478
You stand by your principles,

45
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,398
and your people stand by you.

46
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,884
Those are the qualities
of a true leader.

47
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,883
There is only one leader in Sanctum.

48
00:02:56,149 --> 00:02:58,860
Kneel before him or die.

49
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:06,141
Death... is life.

50
00:03:54,676 --> 00:03:56,747
_

51
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:07,692
We were so close.

52
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,302
Bill, I know you're upset.

53
00:04:10,327 --> 00:04:14,279
Upset? Why would I be upset,

54
00:04:14,304 --> 00:04:16,003
just because we're back to square one,

55
00:04:16,028 --> 00:04:17,622
randomly entering codes?

56
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:19,592
You told me Clarke had the key.

57
00:04:19,877 --> 00:04:22,220
Actually, Octavia's memories did that.

58
00:04:22,401 --> 00:04:24,597
You just never saw the
moment the Flame came out.

59
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,516
You let me believe it never did.

60
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:35,650
My Shepherd, may I have a moment?

61
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,972
Of course.

62
00:04:38,157 --> 00:04:39,700
Everybody out.

63
00:04:44,392 --> 00:04:46,661
You look good in white.

64
00:04:46,846 --> 00:04:48,597
Lock him up with the others.

65
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,666
Let's go. Move it.

66
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,428
You're wondering what will
happen to your friends.

67
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,638
Yes, my Shepherd.

68
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,265
Join me, please.

69
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:16,316
Mmm. Broth.

70
00:05:16,404 --> 00:05:18,817
I'd have killed for this
during my time on the mountain.

71
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:22,947
I heard about First Disciple Anders.

72
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,782
I assume you two were close.

73
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,409
I'm very sorry.

74
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,827
Close?

75
00:05:29,457 --> 00:05:30,790
I met him twice.

76
00:05:30,815 --> 00:05:32,283
I usually only meet the first disciple

77
00:05:32,307 --> 00:05:34,354
once when they come to
wake me every 20 years

78
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:37,879
to say there's been no
progress to the last war.

79
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:41,382
Anders woke me twice.

80
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:43,801
The second time, we had found the key,

81
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:48,434
so, yes, I suppose, I mean,
comparatively speaking,

82
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:49,562
we were close,

83
00:05:49,587 --> 00:05:51,726
but that's not what you meant, is it?

84
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,481
You were testing me to see if I live

85
00:05:53,506 --> 00:05:56,189
by the same code that I
expect of my disciples.

86
00:05:56,434 --> 00:05:59,576
Yes. Forgive me.

87
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:02,687
I don't want to cause you
any more pain, Bellamy,

88
00:06:03,314 --> 00:06:05,314
but your friends have to
pay for what they've done.

89
00:06:05,388 --> 00:06:06,931
Their crimes go beyond Anders.

90
00:06:06,956 --> 00:06:09,702
Dozens of disciples are
dead because of them.

91
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:12,663
What if there was a
way to fix the Flame?

92
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,383
- Bellamy.
- With the technology you have here,

93
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:16,751
it could be possible.

94
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:19,158
And you'll help me get it

95
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:22,208
as long as I don't harm your friends?

96
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:26,969
Don't be ashamed.

97
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,417
The path is new to you.

98
00:06:28,442 --> 00:06:29,665
I've walked it for centuries,

99
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,333
and it's still hard.

100
00:06:31,912 --> 00:06:34,310
You remind me of my son Reese.

101
00:06:34,619 --> 00:06:35,829
He went in search of the Flame.

102
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,063
I never saw him again.

103
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,008
I think my daughter killed him.

104
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:41,928
I'll never know for sure.

105
00:06:41,953 --> 00:06:43,986
Well, if I can get the Flame

106
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:46,864
and your daughter really is in there,

107
00:06:47,112 --> 00:06:48,614
you can find out.

108
00:06:56,095 --> 00:06:59,126
All right. If you can get it

109
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:01,232
and if we can repair it

110
00:07:01,397 --> 00:07:04,387
and if it contains the
code to the last war,

111
00:07:04,412 --> 00:07:07,356
your friends will be absolved.

112
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:22,623
It's so good to see both of you.

113
00:07:22,648 --> 00:07:25,536
Echo, your face.

114
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:27,447
Tell us this is a joke.

115
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,552
These clothes, the way
you betrayed us to Cadogan.

116
00:07:30,577 --> 00:07:32,493
Tell us this is part of some plan.

117
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,135
Keep your voice down.
They are listening,

118
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,722
- and we don't have much time.
- Here's the part

119
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:36,921
where you tell us how screwed we are.

120
00:07:36,945 --> 00:07:40,810
Very. You're to be executed.

121
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:44,546
There is one thing that
can stop it, the Flame.

122
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:46,966
The Flame that you told
Cadogan we destroyed?

123
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,968
We believe it can be repaired.

124
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,678
We?

125
00:07:52,447 --> 00:07:54,324
I don't know where it is.

126
00:07:55,855 --> 00:07:59,546
Raven, you were there.

127
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,415
Who took it after it came out of Madi?

128
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,838
I don't know, and if I did,

129
00:08:02,863 --> 00:08:04,532
I wouldn't tell you.

130
00:08:09,462 --> 00:08:10,838
Yes.

131
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,414
Take this one to M-Cap.

132
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,957
Bellamy, no!

133
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,319
Get off me don't touch me.

134
00:08:21,476 --> 00:08:23,478
So much for family.

135
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,005
Move.

136
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,263
Who the hell are you?

137
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:35,681
I'm the man you love.

138
00:08:35,706 --> 00:08:39,563
The man I love would not
be OK with torturing Raven.

139
00:08:39,588 --> 00:08:40,853
It's not torture.

140
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:44,141
It is if you fight it.

141
00:08:44,465 --> 00:08:47,085
I know these people, Bellamy.

142
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,703
I trained for 5 years to pass as one.

143
00:08:50,728 --> 00:08:52,155
Then I spent another 3 months,

144
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,158
and I actually became one,

145
00:08:54,183 --> 00:08:56,310
all so I could save you

146
00:08:57,553 --> 00:08:59,830
and then avenge you.

147
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,947
I'm sorry you went through that.

148
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:03,619
Are you?

149
00:09:05,664 --> 00:09:07,718
Because it looks to me
like while I was out there

150
00:09:07,743 --> 00:09:09,632
doing everything I could to get to you,

151
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,934
you were forgetting me,

152
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:13,704
forgetting your friends,

153
00:09:13,729 --> 00:09:15,546
who your family is.

154
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:20,076
I scarred my own face to remind myself

155
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,020
of who I was and where I came from

156
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:27,427
so I wouldn't lose myself while
I let them play with my mind.

157
00:09:27,831 --> 00:09:30,903
You've lost yourself, Bellamy.

158
00:09:31,101 --> 00:09:32,847
This isn't you.

159
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:36,037
I'm trying to save all of you.

160
00:09:37,252 --> 00:09:41,534
And what happens if you
can't find the Flame?

161
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,017
You just gonna stand by and watch

162
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,297
as they execute us?

163
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,311
You know I don't want that.

164
00:09:48,336 --> 00:09:50,169
That's not what I asked.

165
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,072
What do you do when you believe

166
00:09:55,097 --> 00:09:57,223
in something with all your heart

167
00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:01,033
that people you love think is crazy?

168
00:10:03,155 --> 00:10:04,782
I don't know.

169
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,398
Watch us all die, I suppose.

170
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:14,870
Is this thing you believe in

171
00:10:16,546 --> 00:10:18,423
really that important?

172
00:10:22,407 --> 00:10:24,451
Is it more important than us?

173
00:10:30,784 --> 00:10:31,993
Yes.

174
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,886
The end of war,

175
00:10:37,181 --> 00:10:39,684
no more senseless death

176
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:41,582
or killing.

177
00:10:43,131 --> 00:10:45,843
The Shepherd can deliver us there, Echo.

178
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,775
All of us,

179
00:10:51,112 --> 00:10:52,443
for all mankind.

180
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:21,857
_

181
00:11:22,254 --> 00:11:23,992
_

182
00:11:26,024 --> 00:11:29,166
_

183
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:35,936
_

184
00:11:36,342 --> 00:11:37,571

185
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,572

186
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,905
_

187
00:11:44,572 --> 00:11:46,747
Isn't that right, Indra?

188
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,401
Excuse me?

189
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,128
Oh, you heard me. You hear everything.

190
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,856
What about her daughter?

191
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:57,007
Gaia. She's among the missing.

192
00:11:57,278 --> 00:11:58,770
We believe she's in
the woods with a group

193
00:11:58,794 --> 00:12:00,469
led by Clarke Griffin.

194
00:12:00,714 --> 00:12:03,097
They're armed and extremely dangerous.

195
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,099
Indra led a search party to find her.

196
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:06,517
I was on it.

197
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,394
There's no sign of them,

198
00:12:08,538 --> 00:12:10,206
but we did see this.

199
00:12:13,077 --> 00:12:15,776
_

200
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:18,149
Why do you have Madi's book?

201
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,513
We have a deal.

202
00:12:20,538 --> 00:12:23,354
I kneel to you, the child is spared.

203
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:26,300
Well, that was before she went
into hiding with my enemies.

204
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:29,707
- Are you my enemy, Indra?
- No.

205
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,208
Tell me where she is.

206
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,055
I don't know.

207
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,714
Have Trikru clean up this mess.

208
00:12:44,358 --> 00:12:46,443
You, convict.

209
00:12:46,572 --> 00:12:47,990
Come.

210
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,937
_

211
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:06,253
Play dead.

212
00:13:30,482 --> 00:13:32,688
The coast is clear.
You can come out now.

213
00:13:38,386 --> 00:13:39,839
It's OK.

214
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,512
We got clothing and medical supplies.

215
00:13:43,537 --> 00:13:46,075
Jackson said to only change
the grossest bandages.

216
00:13:46,212 --> 00:13:50,042
Prioritize the antibiotics.
Highest fevers only, you understand?

217
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:51,497
There's no food.

218
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,774
We're working on that.

219
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,155
Jackson's getting us some bread.

220
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,141
Maybe we should just kneel.

221
00:13:56,306 --> 00:14:00,026
What? No. Trey, everybody
down there, including you

222
00:14:00,051 --> 00:14:02,591
lost people at Sheidheda's big debut.

223
00:14:02,781 --> 00:14:04,009
He knows that.

224
00:14:04,146 --> 00:14:05,732
You're scared, but if he lets you live,

225
00:14:05,757 --> 00:14:07,322
eventually that fear's
gonna turn to anger.

226
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,493
You're gonna want
revenge and rightfully so.

227
00:14:09,518 --> 00:14:11,934
He will kill you to prevent that.

228
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,423
What are we supposed to do?

229
00:14:13,448 --> 00:14:14,711
We can't just hide down there forever.

230
00:14:14,735 --> 00:14:17,591
We are working on that, too, I promise.

231
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,623
And we trust you.

232
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,487
Come on, Trey. Let's
pass this stuff out.

233
00:14:29,546 --> 00:14:31,674
I was right to believe in you.

234
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:41,671
I'm proud of you, too.

235
00:14:41,816 --> 00:14:43,818
Yeah? What for?

236
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,912
Trey's right. Hoping that we survive

237
00:14:47,937 --> 00:14:49,935
long enough for our
friends to come and save us

238
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,629
is not a plan.

239
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,753
You're smiling?

240
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:58,769
Heh. Sorry. It's just...

241
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:03,055
you're not worried about yourself,

242
00:15:04,174 --> 00:15:05,840
and I find that...

243
00:15:06,557 --> 00:15:08,723
incredibly sexy.

244
00:15:09,731 --> 00:15:13,072
Hmm. Behavior that greatly increases

245
00:15:13,097 --> 00:15:15,472
our risk of death is sexy to you?

246
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,128
- Who knew?
- Yeah.

247
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,913
- Ooh!
- Oh, ow.

248
00:15:25,938 --> 00:15:28,898
Ha! Ow.

249
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,482
It's no castle. Ha ha!

250
00:15:31,507 --> 00:15:33,176
No.

251
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:39,688
Even a cave... garage...

252
00:15:42,437 --> 00:15:44,648
with you, all of them are castles.

253
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,375
Is it Jackson again?

254
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,831
I don't think so. Stay here.

255
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:13,584
Indra.

256
00:16:15,587 --> 00:16:17,187
What the hell is that?
What have you got?

257
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,357
Sheidheda slaughtered
the Children of Gabriel.

258
00:16:25,757 --> 00:16:27,467
They didn't kneel.

259
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,283
All of them?

260
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,076
Almost all.

261
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,620
Hey. Hey. It's OK.

262
00:16:36,749 --> 00:16:39,168
It's OK. I got you,
kid. Come on, come on.

263
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:43,836
Hey.

264
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,017
Can you protect him?

265
00:16:45,042 --> 00:16:47,032
I think we might know a place.

266
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,092
You're safe now. Come on.

267
00:16:50,316 --> 00:16:53,152
Hey. Yeah. OK.

268
00:16:56,004 --> 00:16:57,596
There's more.

269
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,477
Sheidheda is looking for Madi.

270
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,313
If he finds her, he'll kill you, too.

271
00:17:03,498 --> 00:17:05,750
Yeah. Trust me, I'm aware.

272
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,569
Do you have any weapons?

273
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,763
Nuclear reactor count?

274
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:21,324
I'm proud of you, Murphy.

275
00:17:21,754 --> 00:17:23,297
Yeah. Get in line.

276
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:32,551
Hmm.

277
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,056
OK. Here we go.

278
00:17:42,363 --> 00:17:43,520
What happened?

279
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,230
It's not his blood.

280
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,566
Take him to the decon
shower, clean him up.

281
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,448
Don't push him to talk.

282
00:17:54,696 --> 00:17:56,950
Yesterday, he lost
his biological parents,

283
00:17:57,173 --> 00:18:00,245
and today, his people were killed.

284
00:18:00,403 --> 00:18:02,289
What can I do for him?

285
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,459
Just be there, be his friend.

286
00:18:28,521 --> 00:18:29,775
Indra?

287
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,960
No, but she said you could hide me.

288
00:18:43,701 --> 00:18:45,374
Did she now?

289
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:47,918
Because I think Indra
knows me better than that.

290
00:18:48,145 --> 00:18:51,870
Hiding people from a one-eyed
mass-murdering dictator

291
00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:53,439
not really a survivor's move.

292
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:59,763
Neither is not inviting me in. Drop it.

293
00:19:01,971 --> 00:19:03,306
Sheidheda asked me to follow her.

294
00:19:03,331 --> 00:19:04,474
I'm so glad it led me here.

295
00:19:04,499 --> 00:19:06,474
- Open the reactor door.
- I don't know the code.

296
00:19:06,499 --> 00:19:08,438
- First one goes in your leg.
- Fine. Easy, easy.

297
00:19:08,463 --> 00:19:09,558
OK, OK, OK.

298
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,400
- 1...
- Don't shoot.

299
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,974
2...

300
00:19:25,155 --> 00:19:27,142
Hands where I can see them.

301
00:19:28,185 --> 00:19:29,895
Nice and slow.

302
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:41,013
Jackpot.

303
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,304
Hey. How'd I look on camera?

304
00:19:47,329 --> 00:19:49,021
Oh, good.

305
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,565
- She followed Indra?
- Yeah.

306
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:56,043
You know, I'm starting to
miss being a live coward.

307
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:11,353
It might help to talk about it.

308
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:15,411
We're not friends.

309
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:17,948
Why would I talk to you?

310
00:20:19,771 --> 00:20:21,690
Good question.

311
00:20:23,277 --> 00:20:25,904
Maybe because I'm the only one here...

312
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,260
or maybe because you
don't have any friends,

313
00:20:31,285 --> 00:20:33,870
which I can totally relate to.

314
00:20:36,683 --> 00:20:39,602
I was raised alone on a spaceship.

315
00:20:41,062 --> 00:20:43,492
You were raised alone on a planet.

316
00:20:43,626 --> 00:20:47,133
We both heard stories
about all the people

317
00:20:47,158 --> 00:20:48,705
we're now surrounded by,

318
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,500
but they're not our friends.

319
00:20:53,507 --> 00:20:54,904
When I was 10, the people here

320
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:57,390
abducted my mom and Octavia.

321
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,469
I was left alone,

322
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:04,221
and a man, a prisoner came,

323
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:06,557
and he was my friend.

324
00:21:09,297 --> 00:21:10,992
He raised me.

325
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,826
He trained me. We...

326
00:21:14,701 --> 00:21:16,495
we were gonna rescue them.

327
00:21:21,915 --> 00:21:25,423
I got him killed because
I was too scared to kill,

328
00:21:26,449 --> 00:21:30,536
and I vowed I would never
make that mistake again...

329
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:34,568
And I didn't...

330
00:21:38,434 --> 00:21:40,164
up until the moment I
killed my own mother,

331
00:21:40,189 --> 00:21:42,233
so do you still think we're the same?

332
00:21:45,782 --> 00:21:47,378
Your mom died a hero.

333
00:21:48,323 --> 00:21:50,100
You weren't there.

334
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,315
She saved everyone here,

335
00:21:53,132 --> 00:21:54,507
but I doubt that's why she did it.

336
00:21:54,532 --> 00:21:56,701
You were not there!

337
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,526
She did it to save you.

338
00:21:59,655 --> 00:22:01,532
I wish she hadn't.

339
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,449
She didn't do it to
save your life, Hope.

340
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,581
She did it to save your soul.

341
00:22:18,844 --> 00:22:20,164
I c...

342
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,923
Hey.

343
00:22:24,077 --> 00:22:25,579
It's OK.

344
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,236
Ohh. Why?

345
00:22:34,074 --> 00:22:35,367
I don't know.

346
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,466
I don't.

347
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,911
Oh, it hurts.

348
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,404
Let it out.

349
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,966
Something funny?

350
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:08,595
Because I don't see
anything humorous about this.

351
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,980
I'm smiling because I realized

352
00:23:12,282 --> 00:23:14,518
I finally understand you.

353
00:23:15,746 --> 00:23:19,175
Really? How so?

354
00:23:19,818 --> 00:23:21,865
You have Madi, I have Hope.

355
00:23:22,921 --> 00:23:25,131
I'd do anything to keep her safe.

356
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,534
How long were you on Penance?

357
00:23:30,738 --> 00:23:32,587
We call it Skyring.

358
00:23:34,096 --> 00:23:36,848
10 years. Good ones.

359
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,422
What?

360
00:23:43,563 --> 00:23:46,412
A couple of days ago, she
was just our little girl.

361
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,344
Now she's messed up like the rest of us.

362
00:24:01,868 --> 00:24:04,367
You need backup to talk to us now?

363
00:24:05,263 --> 00:24:06,730
It's OK.

364
00:24:13,112 --> 00:24:14,899
It's about time.

365
00:24:15,129 --> 00:24:17,238
I have been racking my brain,

366
00:24:17,263 --> 00:24:19,476
trying to figure out
how you telling Cadogan

367
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:21,834
the truth about the Flame helps us.

368
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,381
You know what I've come up with?

369
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,756
It doesn't.

370
00:24:28,526 --> 00:24:30,093
I couldn't lie to him.

371
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,219
Really?

372
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,679
Why not?

373
00:24:34,661 --> 00:24:36,413
I had an experience,

374
00:24:36,438 --> 00:24:39,394
something that changed me to my core,

375
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:41,317
something that explains

376
00:24:41,342 --> 00:24:44,541
why we're still here
and where we're going.

377
00:24:44,882 --> 00:24:47,194
It came to me in a vision.

378
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:48,913
Mom was there.

379
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,215
The Shepherd led me to her,

380
00:24:52,763 --> 00:24:55,660
and there was a light,
and it was beautiful

381
00:24:55,945 --> 00:24:58,723
and warm and peaceful,

382
00:24:59,658 --> 00:25:01,263
and I chose it,

383
00:25:02,547 --> 00:25:06,634
and when I opened my
eyes, the storm had passed

384
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:08,621
just like that.

385
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,469
- Bellamy...
- Clarke, I...

386
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,939
I know how this sounds, but it's real.

387
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,186
A war is coming,

388
00:25:18,495 --> 00:25:21,630
the last war we will ever fight.

389
00:25:22,034 --> 00:25:23,313
Win it,

390
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:25,614
and we become the light.

391
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:28,360
Is that what the cult leader told you?

392
00:25:28,385 --> 00:25:30,595
Did he tell you what happens if we lose?

393
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:33,156
- We won't.
- We turn into crystal,

394
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:35,116
wiped out

395
00:25:35,352 --> 00:25:37,327
like Medusa turning people into stone.

396
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,287
It's the end of everything.

397
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,915
Not everything, just us.

398
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,879
If I told you the AI
that destroyed the Earth

399
00:25:44,904 --> 00:25:46,562
was storing our minds
in the City of Light,

400
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:49,038
would that be any more believable?

401
00:25:49,063 --> 00:25:51,372
What about a group of astronauts
turning themselves into gods

402
00:25:51,396 --> 00:25:53,148
by transferring their
minds into the bodies

403
00:25:53,173 --> 00:25:55,244
of their own followers
in order to live forever?

404
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:59,699
OK. Yes. We've seen our share of crazy,

405
00:26:00,015 --> 00:26:03,298
but that doesn't change the
fact that fighting some war

406
00:26:03,323 --> 00:26:05,473
to become the light is as ridiculous

407
00:26:05,498 --> 00:26:07,190
as the clothes you're wearing.

408
00:26:07,382 --> 00:26:09,050
There's one way to find out.

409
00:26:11,077 --> 00:26:12,958
Tell me where the Flame is.

410
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,759
No.

411
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,119
Clarke, yesterday,
you were offering it up

412
00:26:19,323 --> 00:26:21,504
in exchange for safe passage.

413
00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:23,373
Yesterday, I was bluffing.

414
00:26:23,552 --> 00:26:25,262
I made a deal to save my friends,

415
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:27,112
knowing damn well I had no intention

416
00:26:27,137 --> 00:26:28,670
of following through with it.

417
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,619
Today, I'm standing in
front of my best friend,

418
00:26:30,644 --> 00:26:32,549
who I thought was dead,

419
00:26:32,636 --> 00:26:33,921
and I don't even recognize him.

420
00:26:33,946 --> 00:26:35,992
Clarke, I am the same person

421
00:26:36,017 --> 00:26:37,679
who brought you back from the dead,

422
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,515
who refused to give up on you.

423
00:26:40,636 --> 00:26:43,560
There is so much more at
stake here than you know,

424
00:26:43,857 --> 00:26:46,182
and I know you don't
believe in transcendence,

425
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:48,008
but I'm telling you it's real,

426
00:26:48,325 --> 00:26:52,235
and I am asking you to believe in me.

427
00:26:52,341 --> 00:26:53,967
Even if you're right,

428
00:26:54,198 --> 00:26:57,341
even if everything
you're saying is true,

429
00:26:57,862 --> 00:27:01,413
I will not help that man start his war.

430
00:27:09,047 --> 00:27:10,760
Tell me where the Flame is.

431
00:27:10,928 --> 00:27:12,379
Or what?

432
00:27:13,785 --> 00:27:15,895
Dozens of disciples are dead,

433
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,578
including First Disciple Anders.

434
00:27:17,603 --> 00:27:20,220
Yes, and every one of them

435
00:27:20,245 --> 00:27:22,140
has tried to keep us
from saving our friends.

436
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:26,935
And now I am trying to
save you, all of you.

437
00:27:27,983 --> 00:27:31,404
Clarke, if you don't
tell me where it is,

438
00:27:32,514 --> 00:27:35,100
they will execute all of you.

439
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:38,340
Please let me help.

440
00:27:40,648 --> 00:27:42,858
Go float yourself.

441
00:27:58,742 --> 00:27:59,928
Guards.

442
00:28:02,207 --> 00:28:03,417
Take this one to M-Cap.

443
00:28:03,442 --> 00:28:05,110
What?!

444
00:28:05,135 --> 00:28:06,207
Come on. Let's go.

445
00:28:06,232 --> 00:28:07,691
Hey. Wait.

446
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,236
Bellamy, what are you doing?

447
00:28:10,623 --> 00:28:12,124
What I have to do.

448
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,562
They all hate me.

449
00:28:37,137 --> 00:28:39,139
They don't know what we know.

450
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,291
When we transcend,

451
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,508
they will understand.

452
00:28:49,451 --> 00:28:51,453
For all mankind.

453
00:28:53,014 --> 00:28:54,599
For all mankind.

454
00:29:04,468 --> 00:29:06,451
Our guest is awake.

455
00:29:06,476 --> 00:29:09,618
Yeah, and she snores worse than you do.

456
00:29:11,157 --> 00:29:13,973
Hey. It's OK. She can't hurt anyone.

457
00:29:13,998 --> 00:29:16,991
You know, actually, I've been
wondering about something.

458
00:29:17,697 --> 00:29:19,601
You think Hatch would have kneeled?

459
00:29:21,022 --> 00:29:22,052
I bet he would have.

460
00:29:22,077 --> 00:29:23,554
I think he probably would have even made

461
00:29:23,578 --> 00:29:25,079
Sheidheda think he was working for him.

462
00:29:25,103 --> 00:29:27,991
He wouldn't have actually done
the work, though, would he?

463
00:29:29,564 --> 00:29:30,999
Yeah. That's what I thought.

464
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,066
You see that patch over there?

465
00:29:39,389 --> 00:29:42,048
Hatch and I welded that into place.

466
00:29:42,873 --> 00:29:45,307
See, he already knew he was gonna die.

467
00:29:45,611 --> 00:29:47,467
All his men were down, and Raven,

468
00:29:47,492 --> 00:29:49,413
in one of her more questionable moments

469
00:29:49,438 --> 00:29:50,887
that I nevertheless respect,

470
00:29:50,912 --> 00:29:52,888
locked me in here with him.

471
00:29:54,253 --> 00:29:56,037
She didn't think he
was gonna finish the job

472
00:29:56,062 --> 00:29:57,784
once he knew, but he did.

473
00:29:58,693 --> 00:30:00,069
You know why?

474
00:30:01,837 --> 00:30:03,053
To save you.

475
00:30:03,797 --> 00:30:05,591
That's what he said.

476
00:30:09,011 --> 00:30:12,977
Now... ahem... if you
don't stop freaking out,

477
00:30:13,193 --> 00:30:15,063
we are gonna have to
hold you in the core,

478
00:30:15,368 --> 00:30:17,041
where the radiation from the reactor

479
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:19,033
that he helped keep from melting down

480
00:30:19,058 --> 00:30:21,994
will eventually kill you.

481
00:30:22,431 --> 00:30:24,050
His sacrifice will be worthless.

482
00:30:24,075 --> 00:30:26,717
Personally, I don't want
to see that happen. Do you?

483
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:31,056
Good. Look. When this is all over,

484
00:30:31,081 --> 00:30:33,458
we'll drink to him in the tavern, OK?

485
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,209
OK.

486
00:30:43,034 --> 00:30:44,702
All right. I'm awesome.

487
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,859
Apologies, my Shepherd,

488
00:30:55,884 --> 00:30:58,790
but the neural link won't engage
with her fighting like this.

489
00:30:58,956 --> 00:31:00,726
Keep trying.

490
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,028
Clarke, tell us where the Flame is.

491
00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:08,199
Sir, she's dangerously
close to hemorrhaging.

492
00:31:08,352 --> 00:31:09,993
Sir,

493
00:31:10,153 --> 00:31:12,203
I don't think she knows.

494
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,622
She does...

495
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,291
Or she wouldn't be fighting.

496
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,961
Turn it off.

497
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:27,927
I'm sorry, Bellamy.
You did what you could.

498
00:31:28,143 --> 00:31:30,187
Send the first of her
friends to Penance.

499
00:31:35,891 --> 00:31:37,261
Wait.

500
00:31:38,666 --> 00:31:40,773
I'll take you to it

501
00:31:41,063 --> 00:31:43,735
but only once all my friends are safe.

502
00:31:43,896 --> 00:31:45,165
Done.

503
00:31:45,928 --> 00:31:47,388
Bellamy.

504
00:31:51,182 --> 00:31:52,975
It didn't have to be like this.

505
00:31:57,631 --> 00:31:59,174
Yes, it did.

506
00:32:21,562 --> 00:32:23,816
Let the others do that, Indra.

507
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:27,443
You ordered Trikru
to clean up the blood.

508
00:32:28,634 --> 00:32:30,712
I'm Trikru.

509
00:32:31,189 --> 00:32:32,992
Don't remind me.

510
00:32:33,133 --> 00:32:36,037
When you're done, clean yourself up.

511
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,649
The festivities are about to begin.

512
00:32:37,674 --> 00:32:38,967
Heda, for you.

513
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:45,755
Oh, my, knight.

514
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,178
Hmm.

515
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,187
It's perfect.

516
00:33:14,813 --> 00:33:16,190
There's more, Heda.

517
00:33:16,215 --> 00:33:17,759
Bring it in.

518
00:33:46,074 --> 00:33:48,285
Saved the best for last.

519
00:33:48,335 --> 00:33:51,070
The convict you had follow
Indra has gone missing.

520
00:33:51,232 --> 00:33:53,539
Fortunately, I took it upon myself

521
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,608
to have that convict followed.

522
00:34:11,293 --> 00:34:12,809
Fine.

523
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,579
Then we won't eat either.

524
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,698
After the deathwave,

525
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:20,632
I didn't eat for more than two weeks.

526
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,852
Deathwave?

527
00:34:23,021 --> 00:34:26,698
A wave of radioactive
fire taller than any tree.

528
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,217
The fire jumped our valley.

529
00:34:33,019 --> 00:34:35,504
The radiation didn't.

530
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,162
Everyone I knew died.

531
00:34:39,666 --> 00:34:41,000
My parents.

532
00:34:44,511 --> 00:34:47,137
I was alone for 58 days.

533
00:34:48,183 --> 00:34:50,602
I still dream about it sometimes...

534
00:34:53,188 --> 00:34:54,982
but Clarke helped me through it.

535
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,891
Friends can be good at that, too.

536
00:35:19,674 --> 00:35:21,968
I wish I knew you as a kid.

537
00:35:26,647 --> 00:35:28,733
How about we go back upstairs,

538
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,622
finish what we started?

539
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,508
John!

540
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,487
You think they have engine troubles?

541
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,566
- Here.
- What?

542
00:35:44,591 --> 00:35:47,063
- Stay here.
- No. I'm coming with you.

543
00:35:47,088 --> 00:35:49,755
He'll expect to see both of us.

544
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,733
So we got in a fight.
You went for a walk.

545
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:53,985
Don't worry. I'll sell it.

546
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,929
What if you don't?

547
00:35:56,682 --> 00:35:59,032
You'll be on the wrong side of the door.

548
00:36:01,504 --> 00:36:03,214
You'll be on the right side.

549
00:36:09,227 --> 00:36:10,687
I've got this.

550
00:36:13,992 --> 00:36:15,661
I'm coming back.

551
00:36:28,068 --> 00:36:30,287
Oh, thank God you're back. I...

552
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,857
Hmm. You're not Emori.

553
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:35,067
May we come in?

554
00:36:35,132 --> 00:36:36,675
It's a little late.

555
00:36:43,788 --> 00:36:46,249
- He knows.
- Yeah. I figured.

556
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,153
Hmm.

557
00:36:54,978 --> 00:36:56,534
Open it.

558
00:36:57,561 --> 00:36:59,355
What, the reactor?

559
00:37:09,234 --> 00:37:11,218
I like you, John,

560
00:37:11,953 --> 00:37:14,982
but our relationship's at a crossroads.

561
00:37:15,294 --> 00:37:16,499
Open that door,

562
00:37:16,524 --> 00:37:19,845
and you and your
Frikdreina girlfriend live.

563
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:22,095
I told you not to call her that.

564
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,099
Hey. Cyclops.

565
00:37:30,468 --> 00:37:33,190
- Hmm.
- Yeah. That's right.

566
00:37:34,499 --> 00:37:37,380
If anything happens to John,

567
00:37:37,563 --> 00:37:39,173
I blow the reactor.

568
00:37:39,396 --> 00:37:43,052
If you try to come in here, guess what.

569
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,013
I blow the reactor.

570
00:37:46,072 --> 00:37:47,365
They're bluffing, Heda.

571
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,808
Are they?

572
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:51,269
Everyone in there
knows that they're dead

573
00:37:51,294 --> 00:37:53,604
the second that door opens.

574
00:37:53,629 --> 00:37:56,253
In life, that's called
having nothing to lose.

575
00:37:56,278 --> 00:37:58,818
In chess, I believe that's called a...

576
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,174
Stalemate.

577
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:03,778
Game's not over yet, John.

578
00:38:05,015 --> 00:38:07,184
King takes knight!

579
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,127
Stay here, wait them out.

580
00:38:11,151 --> 00:38:13,541
When the door opens, kill them all.

581
00:38:40,054 --> 00:38:42,332
Why are they still restrained?

582
00:38:43,086 --> 00:38:44,697
We had a deal.

583
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,450
Clarke, what is this? What deal?

584
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,057
He releases all of us,

585
00:38:49,082 --> 00:38:50,745
and I take him to the Flame.

586
00:38:50,939 --> 00:38:53,136
You'll forgive me if I have trust issues

587
00:38:53,161 --> 00:38:55,145
where you're concerned.

588
00:38:55,782 --> 00:38:57,910
Remove the restraints one at a time.

589
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,005
Any violence

590
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:02,965
will be met with lethal force.

591
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,968
No one is getting
violent. It's a good thing.

592
00:39:06,121 --> 00:39:07,470
You're being released.

593
00:39:07,495 --> 00:39:09,788
Helmet on to protect your memory.

594
00:39:11,428 --> 00:39:13,221
You good with this?

595
00:39:19,025 --> 00:39:21,129
Helmet on.

596
00:39:21,878 --> 00:39:23,504
Let's go.

597
00:39:24,439 --> 00:39:25,649
Now you.

598
00:39:25,674 --> 00:39:27,300
Helmet on.

599
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,367
Hands up.

600
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:31,494
Sending the fighters first, is that it?

601
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,802
Can't be too careful.

602
00:39:36,796 --> 00:39:38,256
Move it.

603
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:42,829
Let's go.

604
00:39:46,922 --> 00:39:48,507
Go ahead. Step through.

605
00:39:50,707 --> 00:39:52,056
Next.

606
00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:04,918
What are you doing?

607
00:40:04,943 --> 00:40:07,529
Ensuring you keep your part of the deal.

608
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:10,533
He didn't send them to Sanctum.

609
00:40:10,822 --> 00:40:13,694
Correct, and thank you for demonstrating

610
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:15,393
why I didn't send you with them.

611
00:40:15,938 --> 00:40:17,670
We know how the Stone works.

612
00:40:17,695 --> 00:40:19,504
Also correct.

613
00:40:20,195 --> 00:40:21,390
Where are they?

614
00:40:21,415 --> 00:40:24,107
They're safe as I
promised they would be.

615
00:40:24,447 --> 00:40:27,075
I said nothing about
releasing them on Sanctum.

616
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:30,795
You knew about this?

617
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,613
He doesn't know where
they are. Only I do.

618
00:40:33,772 --> 00:40:37,572
I told you, Clarke, I don't trust you.

619
00:40:37,597 --> 00:40:41,104
I do, however, trust the love
you have for your friends,

620
00:40:41,129 --> 00:40:43,732
and once I have the key
and the last war begins,

621
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,361
they'll all be freed

622
00:40:45,805 --> 00:40:48,764
at which point each
of you will be welcome

623
00:40:48,789 --> 00:40:50,558
to fight alongside us,

624
00:40:51,654 --> 00:40:53,844
and if you choose not to, well,

625
00:40:55,598 --> 00:40:57,204
we'll save you anyway.

626
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,630
That is what we mean when we say,

627
00:41:00,036 --> 00:41:01,746
"for all mankind."

628
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,248
Your move, my Liege.

629
00:41:26,126 --> 00:41:27,711
Something's coming through.

630
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,535
Watch it, watch it.

631
00:41:36,815 --> 00:41:38,567
Easy.

632
00:41:43,972 --> 00:41:46,183
What the hell happened here?

633
00:41:46,208 --> 00:41:48,425
Oh, gee. Where to begin.

634
