1
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,470
Of course, we'll kneel.

2
00:00:06,495 --> 00:00:08,230
Was there ever even a question?

3
00:00:08,255 --> 00:00:09,698
These are yours.

4
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:12,880
Ah. Why do I get the
feeling this is good-bye?

5
00:00:12,905 --> 00:00:14,490
The palace is mine now.

6
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,325
So is the farmhouse. For you, that...

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,059
We'll take the machine shop.

8
00:00:20,293 --> 00:00:22,897
You need a mechanic to run
the reactor. She's your girl.

9
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,967
Besides, you wouldn't want
your favorite chess partner

10
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:27,110
to live in a tent, would you?

11
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,946
Fine. Go. Who's next?

12
00:00:30,256 --> 00:00:33,637
_

13
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:37,851
Kneel so that you can fight another day.

14
00:00:38,362 --> 00:00:40,239
Good. I still get to kill you.

15
00:00:44,907 --> 00:00:47,090
Convicts, Children of Gabriel,

16
00:00:47,115 --> 00:00:48,673
welcome to the new Sanctum.

17
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,263
Things have changed quickly,

18
00:00:50,288 --> 00:00:51,961
but the future is full of promise,

19
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:54,246
and to reap the benefits
of this bright, new day,

20
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:56,431
I ask only that you take a knee

21
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,433
to show your loyalty,

22
00:00:58,612 --> 00:01:00,833
a simple gesture that
binds you to a contract

23
00:01:00,858 --> 00:01:02,228
with a single rule...

24
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,221
If at any time you do anything

25
00:01:05,246 --> 00:01:07,699
that I deem disloyal,

26
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,527
you die.

27
00:01:13,242 --> 00:01:15,206
And if we refuse?

28
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,850
You die.

29
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:24,667
In that case,

30
00:01:24,897 --> 00:01:26,169
the killers and the thieves

31
00:01:26,194 --> 00:01:28,654
of Eligius exploration ship number 4

32
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,785
are at your service.

33
00:01:38,193 --> 00:01:39,726
Nelson.

34
00:01:41,094 --> 00:01:44,378
My name is Sachin.

35
00:01:45,645 --> 00:01:48,314
My people and I swore and oath.

36
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:51,259
Better to die free

37
00:01:52,132 --> 00:01:55,559
than worship at the feet of false gods.

38
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:59,119
I will not kneel

39
00:01:59,393 --> 00:02:01,788
tonight or ever.

40
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:10,018
Does this man speak for all of you?

41
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,217
Surely some here would prefer to live.

42
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:17,679
One small genuflection,
and life goes on,

43
00:02:17,807 --> 00:02:20,936
one Sanctum under me
for the benefit of all.

44
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,478
You stand by your principles,

45
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,398
and your people stand by you.

46
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,884
Those are the qualities
of a true leader.

47
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,883
There is only one leader in Sanctum.

48
00:02:56,149 --> 00:02:58,860
Kneel before him or die.

49
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:06,141
Death... is life.

50
00:03:54,676 --> 00:03:56,747
_

51
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:07,692
We were so close.

52
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,302
Bill, I know you're upset.

53
00:04:10,327 --> 00:04:14,279
Upset? Why would I be upset,

54
00:04:14,304 --> 00:04:16,003
just because we're back to square one,

55
00:04:16,028 --> 00:04:17,622
randomly entering codes?

56
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:19,592
You told me Clarke had the key.

57
00:04:19,877 --> 00:04:22,220
Actually, Octavia's memories did that.

58
00:04:22,401 --> 00:04:24,597
You just never saw the
moment the Flame came out.

59
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,516
You let me believe it never did.

60
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:35,650
My Shepherd, may I have a moment?

61
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,972
Of course.

62
00:04:38,157 --> 00:04:39,700
Everybody out.

63
00:04:44,392 --> 00:04:46,661
You look good in white.

64
00:04:46,846 --> 00:04:48,597
Lock him up with the others.

65
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,666
Let's go. Move it.

66
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,428
You're wondering what will
happen to your friends.

67
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,638
Yes, my Shepherd.

68
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,265
Join me, please.

69
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:16,316
Mmm. Broth.

70
00:05:16,404 --> 00:05:18,817
I'd have killed for this
during my time on the mountain.

71
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:22,947
I heard about First Disciple Anders.

72
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,782
I assume you two were close.

73
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,409
I'm very sorry.

74
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,827
Close?

75
00:05:29,457 --> 00:05:30,790
I met him twice.

76
00:05:30,815 --> 00:05:32,283
I usually only meet the first disciple

77
00:05:32,307 --> 00:05:34,354
once when they come to
wake me every 20 years

78
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:37,879
to say there's been no
progress to the last war.

79
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:41,382
Anders woke me twice.

80
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:43,801
The second time, we had found the key,

81
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:48,434
so, yes, I suppose, I mean,
comparatively speaking,

82
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:49,562
we were close,

83
00:05:49,587 --> 00:05:51,726
but that's not what you meant, is it?

84
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,481
You were testing me to see if I live

85
00:05:53,506 --> 00:05:56,189
by the same code that I
expect of my disciples.

86
00:05:56,434 --> 00:05:59,576
Yes. Forgive me.

87
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:02,687
I don't want to cause you
any more pain, Bellamy,

88
00:06:03,314 --> 00:06:05,314
but your friends have to
pay for what they've done.

89
00:06:05,388 --> 00:06:06,931
Their crimes go beyond Anders.

90
00:06:06,956 --> 00:06:09,702
Dozens of disciples are
dead because of them.

91
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:12,663
What if there was a
way to fix the Flame?

92
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,383
- Bellamy.
- With the technology you have here,

93
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:16,751
it could be possible.

94
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:19,158
And you'll help me get it

95
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:22,208
as long as I don't harm your friends?

96
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:26,969
Don't be ashamed.

97
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,417
The path is new to you.

98
00:06:28,442 --> 00:06:29,665
I've walked it for centuries,

99
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,333
and it's still hard.

100
00:06:31,912 --> 00:06:34,310
You remind me of my son Reese.

101
00:06:34,619 --> 00:06:35,829
He went in search of the Flame.

102
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,063
I never saw him again.

103
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,008
I think my daughter killed him.

104
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:41,928
I'll never know for sure.

105
00:06:41,953 --> 00:06:43,986
Well, if I can get the Flame

106
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:46,864
and your daughter really is in there,

107
00:06:47,112 --> 00:06:48,614
you can find out.

108
00:06:56,095 --> 00:06:59,126
All right. If you can get it

109
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:01,232
and if we can repair it

110
00:07:01,397 --> 00:07:04,387
and if it contains the
code to the last war,

111
00:07:04,412 --> 00:07:07,356
your friends will be absolved.

112
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:22,623
It's so good to see both of you.

113
00:07:22,648 --> 00:07:25,536
Echo, your face.

114
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:27,447
Tell us this is a joke.

115
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,552
These clothes, the way
you betrayed us to Cadogan.

116
00:07:30,577 --> 00:07:32,493
Tell us this is part of some plan.

117
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,135
Keep your voice down.
They are listening,

118
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,722
- and we don't have much time.
- Here's the part

119
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:36,921
where you tell us how screwed we are.

120
00:07:36,945 --> 00:07:40,810
Very. You're to be executed.

121
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:44,546
There is one thing that
can stop it, the Flame.

122
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:46,966
The Flame that you told
Cadogan we destroyed?

123
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,968
We believe it can be repaired.

124
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,678
We?

125
00:07:52,447 --> 00:07:54,324
I don't know where it is.

126
00:07:55,855 --> 00:07:59,546
Raven, you were there.

127
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,415
Who took it after it came out of Madi?

128
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,838
I don't know, and if I did,

129
00:08:02,863 --> 00:08:04,532
I wouldn't tell you.

130
00:08:09,462 --> 00:08:10,838
Yes.

131
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,414
Take this one to M-Cap.

132
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,957
Bellamy, no!

133
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,319
Get off me don't touch me.

134
00:08:21,476 --> 00:08:23,478
So much for family.

135
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,005
Move.

136
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,263
Who the hell are you?

137
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:35,681
I'm the man you love.

138
00:08:35,706 --> 00:08:39,563
The man I love would not
be OK with torturing Raven.

139
00:08:39,588 --> 00:08:40,853
It's not torture.

140
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:44,141
It is if you fight it.

141
00:08:44,465 --> 00:08:47,085
I know these people, Bellamy.

142
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,703
I trained for 5 years to pass as one.

143
00:08:50,728 --> 00:08:52,155
Then I spent another 3 months,

144
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,158
and I actually became one,

145
00:08:54,183 --> 00:08:56,310
all so I could save you

146
00:08:57,553 --> 00:08:59,830
and then avenge you.

147
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,947
I'm sorry you went through that.

148
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:03,619
Are you?

149
00:09:05,664 --> 00:09:07,718
Because it looks to me
like while I was out there

150
00:09:07,743 --> 00:09:09,632
doing everything I could to get to you,

151
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,934
you were forgetting me,

152
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:13,704
forgetting your friends,

153
00:09:13,729 --> 00:09:15,546
who your family is.

154
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:20,076
I scarred my own face to remind myself

155
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,020
of who I was and where I came from

156
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:27,427
so I wouldn't lose myself while
I let them play with my mind.

157
00:09:27,831 --> 00:09:30,903
You've lost yourself, Bellamy.

158
00:09:31,101 --> 00:09:32,847
This isn't you.

159
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:36,037
I'm trying to save all of you.

160
00:09:37,252 --> 00:09:41,534
And what happens if you
can't find the Flame?

161
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,017
You just gonna stand by and watch

162
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,297
as they execute us?

163
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,311
You know I don't want that.

164
00:09:48,336 --> 00:09:50,169
That's not what I asked.

165
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,072
What do you do when you believe

166
00:09:55,097 --> 00:09:57,223
in something with all your heart

167
00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:01,033
that people you love think is crazy?

168
00:10:03,155 --> 00:10:04,782
I don't know.

169
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,398
Watch us all die, I suppose.

170
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:14,870
Is this thing you believe in

171
00:10:16,546 --> 00:10:18,423
really that important?

172
00:10:22,407 --> 00:10:24,451
Is it more important than us?

173
00:10:30,784 --> 00:10:31,993
Yes.

174
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,886
The end of war,

175
00:10:37,181 --> 00:10:39,684
no more senseless death

176
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:41,582
or killing.

177
00:10:43,131 --> 00:10:45,843
The Shepherd can deliver us there, Echo.

178
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,775
All of us,

179
00:10:51,112 --> 00:10:52,443
for all mankind.

180
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:21,857
_

181
00:11:22,254 --> 00:11:23,992
_

182
00:11:26,024 --> 00:11:29,166
_

183
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:35,936
_

184
00:11:36,342 --> 00:11:37,571

185
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,572

186
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,905
_

187
00:11:44,572 --> 00:11:46,747
Isn't that right, Indra?

188
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,401
Excuse me?

189
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,128
Oh, you heard me. You hear everything.

190
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,856
What about her daughter?

191
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:57,007
Gaia. She's among the missing.

192
00:11:57,278 --> 00:11:58,770
We believe she's in
the woods with a group

193
00:11:58,794 --> 00:12:00,469
led by Clarke Griffin.

194
00:12:00,714 --> 00:12:03,097
They're armed and extremely dangerous.

195
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,099
Indra led a search party to find her.

196
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:06,517
I was on it.

197
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,394
There's no sign of them,

198
00:12:08,538 --> 00:12:10,206
but we did see this.

199
00:12:13,077 --> 00:12:15,776
_

200
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:18,149
Why do you have Madi's book?

201
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,513
We have a deal.

202
00:12:20,538 --> 00:12:23,354
I kneel to you, the child is spared.

203
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:26,300
Well, that was before she went
into hiding with my enemies.

204
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:29,707
- Are you my enemy, Indra?
- No.

205
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,208
Tell me where she is.

206
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,055
I don't know.

207
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,714
Have Trikru clean up this mess.

208
00:12:44,358 --> 00:12:46,443
You, convict.

209
00:12:46,572 --> 00:12:47,990
Come.

210
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,937
_

211
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:06,253
Play dead.

212
00:13:29,231 --> 00:13:31,437
The coast is
clear. You can come out now.

213
00:13:37,135 --> 00:13:38,588
It's OK.

214
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,261
We got clothing and medical supplies.

215
00:13:42,286 --> 00:13:44,824
Jackson said to only change
the grossest bandages.

216
00:13:44,961 --> 00:13:48,791
Prioritize the antibiotics.
Highest fevers only, you understand?

217
00:13:48,816 --> 00:13:50,246
There's no food.

218
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:51,523
We're working on that.

219
00:13:51,548 --> 00:13:52,904
Jackson's getting us some bread.

220
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:54,890
Maybe we should just kneel.

221
00:13:55,055 --> 00:13:58,775
What? No. Trey, everybody
down there, including you

222
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,340
lost people at Sheidheda's big debut.

223
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:02,758
He knows that.

224
00:14:02,895 --> 00:14:04,481
You're scared, but if he lets you live,

225
00:14:04,506 --> 00:14:06,071
eventually that fear's
gonna turn to anger.

226
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,242
You're gonna want
revenge and rightfully so.

227
00:14:08,267 --> 00:14:10,683
He will kill you to prevent that.

228
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,172
What are we supposed to do?

229
00:14:12,197 --> 00:14:13,460
We can't just hide down there forever.

230
00:14:13,484 --> 00:14:16,340
We are working on that, too, I promise.

231
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,372
And we trust you.

232
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,345
Come on, Trey. Let's
pass this stuff out.

233
00:14:28,404 --> 00:14:30,532
I was right to believe in you.

234
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,529
I'm proud of you, too.

235
00:14:40,674 --> 00:14:42,676
Yeah? What for?

236
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:46,770
Trey's right. Hoping that we survive

237
00:14:46,795 --> 00:14:48,793
long enough for our
friends to come and save us

238
00:14:48,818 --> 00:14:50,487
is not a plan.

239
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:54,611
You're smiling?

240
00:14:54,897 --> 00:14:57,627
Heh. Sorry. It's just...

241
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:01,913
you're not worried about yourself,

242
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:04,698
and I find that...

243
00:15:05,415 --> 00:15:07,581
incredibly sexy.

244
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:11,930
Hmm. Behavior that greatly increases

245
00:15:11,955 --> 00:15:14,330
our risk of death is sexy to you?

246
00:15:19,778 --> 00:15:21,986
- Who knew?
- Yeah.

247
00:15:22,697 --> 00:15:24,771
- Ooh!
- Oh, ow.

248
00:15:24,796 --> 00:15:27,756
Ha! Ow.

249
00:15:28,369 --> 00:15:30,340
It's no castle. Ha ha!

250
00:15:30,365 --> 00:15:32,034
No.

251
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:38,546
Even a cave... garage...

252
00:15:41,295 --> 00:15:43,506
with you, all of them are castles.

253
00:15:50,058 --> 00:15:52,233
Is it Jackson again?

254
00:15:53,368 --> 00:15:56,689
I don't think so. Stay here.

255
00:16:10,857 --> 00:16:12,442
Indra.

256
00:16:14,445 --> 00:16:16,045
What the hell is that?
What have you got?

257
00:16:19,588 --> 00:16:22,215
Sheidheda slaughtered
the Children of Gabriel.

258
00:16:24,615 --> 00:16:26,325
They didn't kneel.

259
00:16:26,598 --> 00:16:28,141
All of them?

260
00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:32,934
Almost all.

261
00:16:32,976 --> 00:16:35,478
Hey. Hey. It's OK.

262
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:38,026
It's OK. I got you,
kid. Come on, come on.

263
00:16:40,687 --> 00:16:42,694
Hey.

264
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:43,875
Can you protect him?

265
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,890
I think we might know a place.

266
00:16:46,865 --> 00:16:48,950
You're safe now. Come on.

267
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:52,010
Hey. Yeah. OK.

268
00:16:54,862 --> 00:16:56,454
There's more.

269
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,335
Sheidheda is looking for Madi.

270
00:16:59,377 --> 00:17:02,171
If he finds her, he'll kill you, too.

271
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:04,608
Yeah. Trust me, I'm aware.

272
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:07,427
Do you have any weapons?

273
00:17:07,452 --> 00:17:09,621
Nuclear reactor count?

274
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:20,182
I'm proud of you, Murphy.

275
00:17:20,612 --> 00:17:22,155
Yeah. Get in line.

276
00:17:30,366 --> 00:17:31,409
Hmm.

277
00:17:32,869 --> 00:17:35,914
OK. Here we go.

278
00:17:41,221 --> 00:17:42,378
What happened?

279
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,088
It's not his blood.

280
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,424
Take him to the decon
shower, clean him up.

281
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:53,306
Don't push him to talk.

282
00:17:53,554 --> 00:17:55,808
Yesterday, he lost
his biological parents,

283
00:17:56,031 --> 00:17:59,103
and today, his people were killed.

284
00:17:59,261 --> 00:18:01,147
What can I do for him?

285
00:18:01,189 --> 00:18:04,317
Just be there, be his friend.

286
00:18:27,379 --> 00:18:28,633
Indra?

287
00:18:28,658 --> 00:18:30,818
No, but
she said you could hide me.

288
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,232
Did she now?

289
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:46,776
Because I think Indra
knows me better than that.

290
00:18:47,003 --> 00:18:50,728
Hiding people from a one-eyed
mass-murdering dictator

291
00:18:50,753 --> 00:18:52,297
not really a survivor's move.

292
00:18:56,197 --> 00:18:58,621
Neither is not inviting me in. Drop it.

293
00:19:00,275 --> 00:19:02,164
Sheidheda asked me to follow her.

294
00:19:02,189 --> 00:19:03,332
I'm so glad it led me here.

295
00:19:03,357 --> 00:19:05,332
- Open the reactor door.
- I don't know the code.

296
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:07,296
- First one goes in your leg.
- Fine. Easy, easy.

297
00:19:07,321 --> 00:19:08,416
OK, OK, OK.

298
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:10,258
- 1...
- Don't shoot.

299
00:19:13,288 --> 00:19:14,832
2...

300
00:19:24,013 --> 00:19:26,000
Hands where I can see them.

301
00:19:27,043 --> 00:19:28,753
Nice and slow.

302
00:19:38,656 --> 00:19:39,871
Jackpot.

303
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:46,162
Hey. How'd I look on camera?

304
00:19:46,187 --> 00:19:47,879
Oh, good.

305
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,423
- She followed Indra?
- Yeah.

306
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:54,901
You know, I'm starting to
miss being a live coward.

307
00:20:06,426 --> 00:20:09,221
It might help to talk about it.

308
00:20:11,927 --> 00:20:13,279
We're not friends.

309
00:20:13,897 --> 00:20:15,816
Why would I talk to you?

310
00:20:17,639 --> 00:20:19,558
Good question.

311
00:20:21,145 --> 00:20:23,772
Maybe because I'm the only one here...

312
00:20:26,762 --> 00:20:29,128
or maybe because you
don't have any friends,

313
00:20:29,153 --> 00:20:31,738
which I can totally relate to.

314
00:20:34,551 --> 00:20:37,470
I was raised alone on a spaceship.

315
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,360
You were raised alone on a planet.

316
00:20:41,494 --> 00:20:45,001
We both heard stories
about all the people

317
00:20:45,026 --> 00:20:46,573
we're now surrounded by,

318
00:20:46,615 --> 00:20:49,368
but they're not our friends.

319
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,772
When I was 10, the people here

320
00:20:52,797 --> 00:20:55,258
abducted my mom and Octavia.

321
00:20:55,582 --> 00:20:57,337
I was left alone,

322
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:02,089
and a man, a prisoner came,

323
00:21:02,257 --> 00:21:04,425
and he was my friend.

324
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:08,860
He raised me.

325
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,694
He trained me. We...

326
00:21:12,569 --> 00:21:14,363
we were gonna rescue them.

327
00:21:19,783 --> 00:21:23,291
I got him killed because
I was too scared to kill,

328
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:28,404
and I vowed I would never
make that mistake again...

329
00:21:30,934 --> 00:21:32,436
And I didn't...

330
00:21:36,302 --> 00:21:38,032
up until the moment I
killed my own mother,

331
00:21:38,057 --> 00:21:40,101
so do you still think we're the same?

332
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,246
Your mom died a hero.

333
00:21:46,191 --> 00:21:47,968
You weren't there.

334
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:50,183
She saved everyone here,

335
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,375
but I doubt that's why she did it.

336
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,569
You were not there!

337
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,394
She did it to save you.

338
00:21:57,523 --> 00:21:59,400
I wish she hadn't.

339
00:22:02,648 --> 00:22:05,317
She didn't do it to
save your life, Hope.

340
00:22:07,821 --> 00:22:10,449
She did it to save your soul.

341
00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:18,032
I c...

342
00:22:18,373 --> 00:22:19,791
Hey.

343
00:22:21,945 --> 00:22:23,447
It's OK.

344
00:22:28,008 --> 00:22:31,104
Ohh. Why?

345
00:22:31,942 --> 00:22:33,235
I don't know.

346
00:22:36,516 --> 00:22:38,334
I don't.

347
00:22:38,818 --> 00:22:40,779
Oh, it hurts.

348
00:22:40,812 --> 00:22:42,272
Let it out.

349
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:02,834
Something funny?

350
00:23:02,876 --> 00:23:06,463
Because I don't see
anything humorous about this.

351
00:23:06,488 --> 00:23:08,848
I'm smiling because I realized

352
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,386
I finally understand you.

353
00:23:13,614 --> 00:23:17,043
Really? How so?

354
00:23:17,686 --> 00:23:19,733
You have Madi, I have Hope.

355
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:22,999
I'd do anything to keep her safe.

356
00:23:26,024 --> 00:23:28,402
How long were you on Penance?

357
00:23:28,606 --> 00:23:30,455
We call it Skyring.

358
00:23:31,964 --> 00:23:34,716
10 years. Good ones.

359
00:23:39,955 --> 00:23:41,290
What?

360
00:23:41,431 --> 00:23:44,280
A couple of days ago, she
was just our little girl.

361
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:47,212
Now she's messed up like the rest of us.

362
00:23:59,736 --> 00:24:02,235
You need backup to talk to us now?

363
00:24:03,131 --> 00:24:04,598
It's OK.

364
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,767
It's about time.

365
00:24:12,997 --> 00:24:15,106
I have been racking my brain,

366
00:24:15,131 --> 00:24:17,344
trying to figure out
how you telling Cadogan

367
00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:19,702
the truth about the Flame helps us.

368
00:24:20,195 --> 00:24:22,249
You know what I've come up with?

369
00:24:23,123 --> 00:24:24,624
It doesn't.

370
00:24:26,394 --> 00:24:27,961
I couldn't lie to him.

371
00:24:28,003 --> 00:24:29,087
Really?

372
00:24:29,129 --> 00:24:30,547
Why not?

373
00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:34,281
I had an experience,

374
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,262
something that changed me to my core,

375
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,185
something that explains

376
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,409
why we're still here
and where we're going.

377
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,062
It came to me in a vision.

378
00:24:45,253 --> 00:24:46,781
Mom was there.

379
00:24:48,065 --> 00:24:50,083
The Shepherd led me to her,

380
00:24:50,631 --> 00:24:53,528
and there was a light,
and it was beautiful

381
00:24:53,813 --> 00:24:56,591
and warm and peaceful,

382
00:24:57,526 --> 00:24:59,131
and I chose it,

383
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:04,502
and when I opened my
eyes, the storm had passed

384
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:06,489
just like that.

385
00:25:08,585 --> 00:25:10,337
- Bellamy...
- Clarke, I...

386
00:25:10,379 --> 00:25:13,807
I know how this sounds, but it's real.

387
00:25:14,257 --> 00:25:16,054
A war is coming,

388
00:25:16,363 --> 00:25:19,498
the last war we will ever fight.

389
00:25:19,902 --> 00:25:21,181
Win it,

390
00:25:21,435 --> 00:25:23,482
and we become the light.

391
00:25:23,683 --> 00:25:26,228
Is that what the cult leader told you?

392
00:25:26,253 --> 00:25:28,463
Did he tell you what happens if we lose?

393
00:25:28,605 --> 00:25:31,024
- We won't.
- We turn into crystal,

394
00:25:31,276 --> 00:25:32,984
wiped out

395
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,195
like Medusa turning people into stone.

396
00:25:35,237 --> 00:25:37,155
It's the end of everything.

397
00:25:37,197 --> 00:25:39,783
Not everything, just us.

398
00:25:39,825 --> 00:25:42,747
If I told you the AI
that destroyed the Earth

399
00:25:42,772 --> 00:25:44,430
was storing our minds
in the City of Light,

400
00:25:44,454 --> 00:25:46,906
would that be any more believable?

401
00:25:46,931 --> 00:25:49,240
What about a group of astronauts
turning themselves into gods

402
00:25:49,264 --> 00:25:51,016
by transferring their
minds into the bodies

403
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:53,112
of their own followers
in order to live forever?

404
00:25:53,137 --> 00:25:57,567
OK. Yes. We've seen our share of crazy,

405
00:25:57,883 --> 00:26:01,166
but that doesn't change the
fact that fighting some war

406
00:26:01,191 --> 00:26:03,341
to become the light is as ridiculous

407
00:26:03,366 --> 00:26:05,058
as the clothes you're wearing.

408
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,918
There's one way to find out.

409
00:26:08,945 --> 00:26:10,826
Tell me where the Flame is.

410
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:12,627
No.

411
00:26:13,608 --> 00:26:16,987
Clarke, yesterday,
you were offering it up

412
00:26:17,191 --> 00:26:19,372
in exchange for safe passage.

413
00:26:19,397 --> 00:26:21,241
Yesterday, I was bluffing.

414
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,130
I made a deal to save my friends,

415
00:26:23,155 --> 00:26:24,980
knowing damn well I had no intention

416
00:26:25,005 --> 00:26:26,538
of following through with it.

417
00:26:26,588 --> 00:26:28,487
Today, I'm standing in
front of my best friend,

418
00:26:28,512 --> 00:26:30,417
who I thought was dead,

419
00:26:30,504 --> 00:26:31,789
and I don't even recognize him.

420
00:26:31,814 --> 00:26:33,860
Clarke, I am the same person

421
00:26:33,885 --> 00:26:35,547
who brought you back from the dead,

422
00:26:35,589 --> 00:26:38,383
who refused to give up on you.

423
00:26:38,504 --> 00:26:41,428
There is so much more at
stake here than you know,

424
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,050
and I know you don't
believe in transcendence,

425
00:26:44,106 --> 00:26:45,876
but I'm telling you it's real,

426
00:26:46,193 --> 00:26:50,103
and I am asking you to believe in me.

427
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:51,835
Even if you're right,

428
00:26:52,066 --> 00:26:55,209
even if everything
you're saying is true,

429
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:59,281
I will not help that man start his war.

430
00:27:06,915 --> 00:27:08,628
Tell me where the Flame is.

431
00:27:08,796 --> 00:27:10,247
Or what?

432
00:27:11,653 --> 00:27:13,763
Dozens of disciples are dead,

433
00:27:13,788 --> 00:27:15,446
including First Disciple Anders.

434
00:27:15,471 --> 00:27:18,088
Yes, and every one of them

435
00:27:18,113 --> 00:27:20,008
has tried to keep us
from saving our friends.

436
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:24,803
And now I am trying to
save you, all of you.

437
00:27:25,851 --> 00:27:29,272
Clarke, if you don't
tell me where it is,

438
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,968
they will execute all of you.

439
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:36,208
Please let me help.

440
00:27:38,516 --> 00:27:40,726
Go float yourself.

441
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:57,796
Guards.

442
00:28:00,075 --> 00:28:01,285
Take this one to M-Cap.

443
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,978
What?!

444
00:28:03,003 --> 00:28:04,075
Come on. Let's go.

445
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,559
Hey. Wait.

446
00:28:05,887 --> 00:28:08,104
Bellamy, what are you doing?

447
00:28:08,491 --> 00:28:09,992
What I have to do.

448
00:28:31,428 --> 00:28:33,430
They all hate me.

449
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:37,007
They don't know what we know.

450
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,159
When we transcend,

451
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,376
they will understand.

452
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:49,321
For all mankind.

453
00:28:50,882 --> 00:28:52,467
For all mankind.

454
00:29:01,548 --> 00:29:03,531
Our guest is awake.

455
00:29:03,556 --> 00:29:06,698
Yeah, and she snores worse than you do.

456
00:29:08,237 --> 00:29:10,874
Hey. It's OK. She can't hurt anyone.

457
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,867
You know, actually, I've been
wondering about something.

458
00:29:14,573 --> 00:29:16,477
You think Hatch would have kneeled?

459
00:29:17,898 --> 00:29:18,928
I bet he would have.

460
00:29:18,953 --> 00:29:20,430
I think he probably would have even made

461
00:29:20,454 --> 00:29:21,955
Sheidheda think he was working for him.

462
00:29:21,979 --> 00:29:24,867
He wouldn't have actually done
the work, though, would he?

463
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,875
Yeah. That's what I thought.

464
00:29:32,107 --> 00:29:33,942
You see that patch over there?

465
00:29:36,265 --> 00:29:38,924
Hatch and I welded that into place.

466
00:29:39,749 --> 00:29:42,183
See, he already knew he was gonna die.

467
00:29:42,487 --> 00:29:44,343
All his men were down, and Raven,

468
00:29:44,368 --> 00:29:46,289
in one of her more questionable moments

469
00:29:46,314 --> 00:29:47,763
that I nevertheless respect,

470
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:49,764
locked me in here with him.

471
00:29:51,129 --> 00:29:52,913
She didn't think he
was gonna finish the job

472
00:29:52,938 --> 00:29:54,660
once he knew, but he did.

473
00:29:55,569 --> 00:29:56,945
You know why?

474
00:29:58,713 --> 00:29:59,929
To save you.

475
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,467
That's what he said.

476
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:09,853
Now... ahem... if you
don't stop freaking out,

477
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:11,939
we are gonna have to
hold you in the core,

478
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:13,917
where the radiation from the reactor

479
00:30:13,942 --> 00:30:15,909
that he helped keep from melting down

480
00:30:15,934 --> 00:30:18,870
will eventually kill you.

481
00:30:19,307 --> 00:30:20,926
His sacrifice will be worthless.

482
00:30:20,951 --> 00:30:23,593
Personally, I don't want
to see that happen. Do you?

483
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,932
Good. Look. When this is all over,

484
00:30:27,957 --> 00:30:30,334
we'll drink to him in the tavern, OK?

485
00:30:31,834 --> 00:30:33,085
OK.

486
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,578
All right. I'm awesome.

487
00:30:51,186 --> 00:30:52,735
Apologies, my Shepherd,

488
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,666
but the neural link won't engage
with her fighting like this.

489
00:30:55,832 --> 00:30:57,602
Keep trying.

490
00:30:58,152 --> 00:31:00,904
Clarke, tell
us where the Flame is.

491
00:31:02,775 --> 00:31:05,075
Sir, she's dangerously
close to hemorrhaging.

492
00:31:05,228 --> 00:31:06,869
Sir,

493
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:09,079
I don't think she knows.

494
00:31:09,486 --> 00:31:11,498
She does...

495
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,167
Or she wouldn't be fighting.

496
00:31:15,335 --> 00:31:16,837
Turn it off.

497
00:31:22,135 --> 00:31:24,803
I'm sorry, Bellamy.
You did what you could.

498
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:27,063
Send the first of her
friends to Penance.

499
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:34,137
Wait.

500
00:31:35,542 --> 00:31:37,649
I'll take you to it

501
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:40,611
but only once all my friends are safe.

502
00:31:40,772 --> 00:31:42,041
Done.

503
00:31:42,804 --> 00:31:44,264
Bellamy.

504
00:31:48,058 --> 00:31:49,851
It didn't have to be like this.

505
00:31:54,507 --> 00:31:56,050
Yes, it did.

506
00:32:17,492 --> 00:32:19,746
Let the others do that, Indra.

507
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:23,373
You ordered Trikru
to clean up the blood.

508
00:32:24,564 --> 00:32:26,642
I'm Trikru.

509
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,922
Don't remind me.

510
00:32:29,063 --> 00:32:31,967
When you're done, clean yourself up.

511
00:32:32,009 --> 00:32:33,579
The festivities are about to begin.

512
00:32:33,604 --> 00:32:34,897
Heda, for you.

513
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:41,685
Oh, my, knight.

514
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:48,108
Hmm.

515
00:32:55,532 --> 00:32:57,117
It's perfect.

516
00:33:10,743 --> 00:33:12,120
There's more, Heda.

517
00:33:12,145 --> 00:33:13,689
Bring it in.

518
00:33:42,004 --> 00:33:44,215
Saved the best for last.

519
00:33:44,265 --> 00:33:47,000
The convict you had follow
Indra has gone missing.

520
00:33:47,162 --> 00:33:49,469
Fortunately, I took it upon myself

521
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:51,538
to have that convict followed.

522
00:34:07,223 --> 00:34:08,739
Fine.

523
00:34:09,773 --> 00:34:11,509
Then we won't eat either.

524
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,628
After the deathwave,

525
00:34:13,653 --> 00:34:16,562
I didn't eat for more than two weeks.

526
00:34:16,905 --> 00:34:18,782
Deathwave?

527
00:34:18,951 --> 00:34:22,628
A wave of radioactive
fire taller than any tree.

528
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,147
The fire jumped our valley.

529
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:31,434
The radiation didn't.

530
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,092
Everyone I knew died.

531
00:34:35,596 --> 00:34:36,930
My parents.

532
00:34:40,441 --> 00:34:43,067
I was alone for 58 days.

533
00:34:44,113 --> 00:34:46,532
I still dream about it sometimes...

534
00:34:49,118 --> 00:34:50,912
but Clarke helped me through it.

535
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,821
Friends can be good at that, too.

536
00:35:15,604 --> 00:35:17,898
I wish I knew you as a kid.

537
00:35:22,577 --> 00:35:24,663
How about we go back upstairs,

538
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,552
finish what we started?

539
00:35:30,062 --> 00:35:31,438
John!

540
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:38,417
You think they have engine troubles?

541
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,496
- Here.
- What?

542
00:35:40,521 --> 00:35:42,993
- Stay here.
- No. I'm coming with you.

543
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:45,685
He'll expect to see both of us.

544
00:35:46,286 --> 00:35:48,663
So we got in a fight.
You went for a walk.

545
00:35:48,705 --> 00:35:49,915
Don't worry. I'll sell it.

546
00:35:49,956 --> 00:35:51,859
What if you don't?

547
00:35:52,612 --> 00:35:54,962
You'll be on the wrong side of the door.

548
00:35:57,434 --> 00:35:59,144
You'll be on the right side.

549
00:36:05,157 --> 00:36:06,617
I've got this.

550
00:36:09,922 --> 00:36:11,591
I'm coming back.

551
00:36:23,998 --> 00:36:26,217
Oh, thank God you're back. I...

552
00:36:26,827 --> 00:36:28,787
Hmm. You're not Emori.

553
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:30,997
May we come in?

554
00:36:31,062 --> 00:36:32,605
It's a little late.

555
00:36:39,718 --> 00:36:42,179
- He knows.
- Yeah. I figured.

556
00:36:47,722 --> 00:36:49,083
Hmm.

557
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:52,464
Open it.

558
00:36:53,491 --> 00:36:55,285
What, the reactor?

559
00:37:05,164 --> 00:37:07,148
I like you, John,

560
00:37:07,883 --> 00:37:10,912
but our relationship's at a crossroads.

561
00:37:11,224 --> 00:37:12,429
Open that door,

562
00:37:12,454 --> 00:37:15,775
and you and your
Frikdreina girlfriend live.

563
00:37:16,042 --> 00:37:18,025
I told you not to call her that.

564
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:21,029
EMORI, ON INTERCOM: Hey. Cyclops.

565
00:37:26,398 --> 00:37:29,120
- Hmm.
- Yeah. That's right.

566
00:37:30,429 --> 00:37:33,310
If anything happens to John,

567
00:37:33,493 --> 00:37:35,103
I blow the reactor.

568
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:38,989
If you try to come in here, guess what.

569
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,943
I blow the reactor.

570
00:37:42,002 --> 00:37:43,295
They're bluffing, Heda.

571
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,738
Are they?

572
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,199
Everyone in there
knows that they're dead

573
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:49,534
the second that door opens.

574
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:52,183
In life, that's called
having nothing to lose.

575
00:37:52,208 --> 00:37:54,748
In chess, I believe that's called a...

576
00:37:54,789 --> 00:37:56,104
Stalemate.

577
00:37:57,676 --> 00:37:59,708
Game's not over yet, John.

578
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,114
King takes knight!

579
00:38:05,634 --> 00:38:07,057
Stay here, wait them out.

580
00:38:07,081 --> 00:38:09,471
When the door opens, kill them all.

581
00:38:34,991 --> 00:38:37,269
Why are they still restrained?

582
00:38:38,023 --> 00:38:39,634
We had a deal.

583
00:38:39,676 --> 00:38:42,387
Clarke, what is this? What deal?

584
00:38:42,428 --> 00:38:43,994
He releases all of us,

585
00:38:44,019 --> 00:38:45,682
and I take him to the Flame.

586
00:38:45,876 --> 00:38:48,073
You'll forgive me if I have trust issues

587
00:38:48,098 --> 00:38:50,082
where you're concerned.

588
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:52,847
Remove the restraints one at a time.

589
00:38:54,023 --> 00:38:55,942
Any violence

590
00:38:56,145 --> 00:38:57,902
will be met with lethal force.

591
00:38:57,944 --> 00:39:00,905
No one is getting
violent. It's a good thing.

592
00:39:01,058 --> 00:39:02,407
You're being released.

593
00:39:02,432 --> 00:39:04,725
Helmet on to protect your memory.

594
00:39:06,365 --> 00:39:08,158
You good with this?

595
00:39:13,962 --> 00:39:16,066
Helmet on.

596
00:39:16,815 --> 00:39:18,441
Let's go.

597
00:39:19,376 --> 00:39:20,586
Now you.

598
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:22,237
Helmet on.

599
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,304
Hands up.

600
00:39:24,345 --> 00:39:26,431
Sending the fighters first, is that it?

601
00:39:29,057 --> 00:39:30,739
Can't be too careful.

602
00:39:31,733 --> 00:39:33,193
Move it.

603
00:39:36,182 --> 00:39:37,766
Let's go.

604
00:39:41,859 --> 00:39:43,444
Go ahead. Step through.

605
00:39:45,644 --> 00:39:46,993
Next.

606
00:39:58,556 --> 00:39:59,855
What are you doing?

607
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,466
Ensuring you keep your part of the deal.

608
00:40:03,135 --> 00:40:05,470
He didn't send them to Sanctum.

609
00:40:05,759 --> 00:40:08,631
Correct, and thank you for demonstrating

610
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,330
why I didn't send you with them.

611
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,607
We know how the Stone works.

612
00:40:12,632 --> 00:40:14,441
Also correct.

613
00:40:15,132 --> 00:40:16,327
Where are they?

614
00:40:16,352 --> 00:40:19,044
They're safe as I
promised they would be.

615
00:40:19,384 --> 00:40:22,012
I said nothing about
releasing them on Sanctum.

616
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,732
You knew about this?

617
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:28,550
He doesn't know where
they are. Only I do.

618
00:40:28,709 --> 00:40:32,509
I told you, Clarke, I don't trust you.

619
00:40:32,534 --> 00:40:36,041
I do, however, trust the love
you have for your friends,

620
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:38,669
and once I have the key
and the last war begins,

621
00:40:38,711 --> 00:40:40,298
they'll all be freed

622
00:40:40,742 --> 00:40:43,701
at which point each
of you will be welcome

623
00:40:43,726 --> 00:40:45,495
to fight alongside us,

624
00:40:46,591 --> 00:40:48,781
and if you choose not to, well,

625
00:40:50,535 --> 00:40:52,141
we'll save you anyway.

626
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:54,567
That is what we mean when we say,

627
00:40:54,973 --> 00:40:56,683
"for all mankind."

628
00:41:10,017 --> 00:41:12,185
Your move, my Liege.

629
00:41:21,063 --> 00:41:22,648
Something's coming through.

630
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:31,472
Watch it, watch it.

631
00:41:31,752 --> 00:41:33,504
Easy.

632
00:41:38,909 --> 00:41:41,120
What the hell happened here?

633
00:41:41,145 --> 00:41:43,362
Oh, gee. Where to begin.

634
