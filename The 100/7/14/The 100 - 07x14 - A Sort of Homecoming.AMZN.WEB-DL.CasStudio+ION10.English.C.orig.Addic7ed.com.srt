1
00:00:00,973 --> 00:00:02,392
Previously on "The 100"...

2
00:00:02,417 --> 00:00:04,290
Where the hell is my daughter?

3
00:00:04,315 --> 00:00:06,658
We didn't know she was
missing until today.

4
00:00:06,683 --> 00:00:07,816
Nobody did.

5
00:00:08,568 --> 00:00:10,535
We're gonna get everyone back.

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,258
I remember things.

7
00:00:12,283 --> 00:00:13,449
Your sketchbook?

8
00:00:13,608 --> 00:00:17,067
Madi, don't tell anyone that...

9
00:00:17,103 --> 00:00:18,303
ever.

10
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,637
We need to get to our friends.

11
00:00:25,747 --> 00:00:27,480
There's your bridge. Go.

12
00:00:27,505 --> 00:00:28,871
You're coming with us.

13
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:30,208
Now move.

14
00:00:30,351 --> 00:00:33,119
You should have more faith, Clarke.

15
00:00:33,144 --> 00:00:34,877
My throne.

16
00:00:35,516 --> 00:00:36,685
The book.

17
00:00:41,953 --> 00:00:42,944
Bellamy...

18
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:44,270
_

19
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:46,533
Don't make me do this.

20
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:49,436
The fate of the entire
human race is at stake.

21
00:00:49,657 --> 00:00:51,794
I have no choice but to share this.

22
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:53,118
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:53,143 --> 00:00:54,642
Me, too.

24
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,393
Clarke!

25
00:01:25,622 --> 00:01:27,355
What is it? What happened?

26
00:01:31,065 --> 00:01:32,164
Where are we?

27
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:34,142
The Second Dawn bunker.

28
00:01:34,277 --> 00:01:36,478
Otherwise known as hell.

29
00:01:36,503 --> 00:01:38,103
Earth?

30
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,516
How?

31
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:44,185
This place is perfect for you.

32
00:01:48,258 --> 00:01:50,225
Nano-tracking program.

33
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:55,897
What is it you say? May we meet again.

34
00:02:02,672 --> 00:02:04,572
Welcome home, Mother.

35
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:07,592
Gaia?

36
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,259
Seda, how are you here?

37
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:29,348
Good question.

38
00:02:30,967 --> 00:02:32,901
He turned off the stone.

39
00:02:33,036 --> 00:02:35,872
Before the bridge
closed, we went through...

40
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:40,012
Landing here.

41
00:02:41,344 --> 00:02:44,879
No. How?

42
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,331
The closing bridge defaults

43
00:02:46,356 --> 00:02:48,623
to the planetary origin of our DNA.

44
00:02:48,758 --> 00:02:50,491
Your journey ends here, too.

45
00:02:50,516 --> 00:02:52,605
He would not
stop talking while we fought.

46
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:54,648
He said when you're
caught in a closing bridge,

47
00:02:54,673 --> 00:02:57,355
it defaults to the
planetary origin of your DNA,

48
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,466
Earth.

49
00:02:58,491 --> 00:02:59,690
For all mankind.

50
00:02:59,715 --> 00:03:01,027
I'm no man.

51
00:03:11,448 --> 00:03:12,947
Where's the head?

52
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,016
Buried with the rest of him.

53
00:03:15,151 --> 00:03:17,952
Until today, no one
even knew you were missing.

54
00:03:18,326 --> 00:03:19,968
How long have you been alone here?

55
00:03:19,993 --> 00:03:23,391
A few days until the
others arrived this morning.

56
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:26,071
I thought it would be
the rest of my life.

57
00:03:26,096 --> 00:03:27,729
We're together now.

58
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:32,630
Echo and Octavia...

59
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,011
where are they?

60
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:49,529
It's so green.

61
00:03:52,188 --> 00:03:53,588
They're over here.

62
00:03:56,346 --> 00:03:58,179
Earth is back.

63
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:08,847
Hey.

64
00:04:08,872 --> 00:04:11,372
- Jax!
- Hey, baby.

65
00:04:11,397 --> 00:04:13,430
Oh, it's good to see you.

66
00:04:13,676 --> 00:04:14,776
I missed you.

67
00:04:14,911 --> 00:04:16,844
- Hey.
- Hi.

68
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,881
- Hey!
- Hey.

69
00:04:19,906 --> 00:04:21,973
It's good to see you.

70
00:04:22,218 --> 00:04:23,851
Hi.

71
00:04:23,987 --> 00:04:25,119
You weren't inside.

72
00:04:25,255 --> 00:04:26,988
- Hey.
- Hey.

73
00:04:28,964 --> 00:04:30,864
Where's Bellamy?

74
00:04:35,698 --> 00:04:37,598
Clarke?

75
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,114
Dead.

76
00:04:44,808 --> 00:04:46,541
He's dead.

77
00:04:46,676 --> 00:04:47,842
Bellamy?

78
00:04:48,007 --> 00:04:49,540
Clarke, he was fine when we left.

79
00:04:49,565 --> 00:04:51,263
- I'm a little confu...
- I killed him.

80
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:05,854
I had to.

81
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:07,962
Why?

82
00:05:10,776 --> 00:05:15,016
Madi's sketchbook. He had it,

83
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:19,684
and he knew that she still has
the memories of the Commander.

84
00:05:19,888 --> 00:05:22,956
She would never be safe.

85
00:05:23,344 --> 00:05:25,318
I begged him to stop.

86
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,079
I tried to get the book back,

87
00:05:28,104 --> 00:05:29,739
but he...

88
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,822
I tried everything, I promise.

89
00:05:32,847 --> 00:05:34,479
I tried.

90
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,560
I'm so sorry.

91
00:05:49,906 --> 00:05:51,372
I understand.

92
00:05:54,444 --> 00:05:56,344
So would the old Bellamy.

93
00:05:58,695 --> 00:06:02,060
The one that would do
anything for his baby sister

94
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:04,721
and the people he loved.

95
00:06:13,549 --> 00:06:16,345
You can hate me if you want to.

96
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,461
God knows I do.

97
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,909
We lost him a long time ago.

98
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,536
He needed all this chaos to make sense,

99
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:32,947
all the violence,

100
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,886
all the people we've killed.

101
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,987
He couldn't accept that
it's all meaningless.

102
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,000
Cadogan gave him meaning,

103
00:06:42,246 --> 00:06:45,147
and that meaning is what killed him...

104
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,723
Not you.

105
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,762
No one wants to live here,

106
00:07:44,787 --> 00:07:47,031
but it will do until we
build our own shelter.

107
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,493
There is a river close by,

108
00:07:48,518 --> 00:07:50,962
so there is plenty of drinking water.

109
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,572
What about food?
You check the hydrofarm?

110
00:07:54,597 --> 00:07:55,652
Nothing.

111
00:07:55,677 --> 00:07:58,678
That whole level was
destroyed in the fire.

112
00:07:59,502 --> 00:08:01,502
Where is Blodreina?

113
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:04,391
She didn't come back inside.

114
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,317
Avoiding her demons.

115
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:07,885
I don't blame her.

116
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,630
Have you found
another food source?

117
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:11,445
We hear birds, insects, so there must...

118
00:08:11,581 --> 00:08:13,904
What about power, hot water?

119
00:08:15,034 --> 00:08:16,533
That's it. I'm out of here.

120
00:08:16,558 --> 00:08:18,019
Where's the funky ball
with the green light?

121
00:08:18,043 --> 00:08:19,905
A way out is the
first thing we looked for.

122
00:08:19,929 --> 00:08:22,032
There's no stone here.

123
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,449
No. There has to be.

124
00:08:23,609 --> 00:08:25,408
That's how Cadogan got his people out.

125
00:08:25,695 --> 00:08:27,561
We lived here for 6 years.

126
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:29,207
I think we would have seen it.

127
00:08:29,232 --> 00:08:30,798
One way to find out.

128
00:08:33,002 --> 00:08:34,493
Raven, we tried that.

129
00:08:34,518 --> 00:08:36,985
Our helmets showed no
trace of the stone anywhere.

130
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,286
100 feet straight down.

131
00:08:42,676 --> 00:08:44,722
They gave you trash helmets
so you couldn't get out.

132
00:08:44,747 --> 00:08:46,529
Perfect. So we jump to Sanctum,

133
00:08:46,554 --> 00:08:49,137
have a hot shower, stock up on supplies.

134
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,101
Bring my people home.

135
00:08:51,687 --> 00:08:54,655
- Raven, can I?
- Yeah.

136
00:09:02,555 --> 00:09:03,888
What the hell are you doing?

137
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:06,534
It's the only way out of here!

138
00:09:06,669 --> 00:09:09,136
Earth is our home.

139
00:09:09,351 --> 00:09:12,285
Everyone who is from here is here...

140
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,530
Everyone we care about,

141
00:09:16,168 --> 00:09:18,969
and I will not lose anyone else.

142
00:09:22,018 --> 00:09:23,717
Let's choose a room.

143
00:09:51,177 --> 00:09:53,944
Pretty pictures, don't you think?

144
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,929
These restraints won't do at all.

145
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,781
You're lucky my people brought you here,

146
00:10:02,806 --> 00:10:05,269
or you'd be dead right now.

147
00:10:05,294 --> 00:10:07,061
I feel lucky.

148
00:10:10,867 --> 00:10:12,900
Did you draw this?

149
00:10:13,074 --> 00:10:16,876
No... but I know who did.

150
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:22,697
Ohh. Incredible.

151
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:25,217
Yes. Our medicine is incredible.

152
00:10:25,242 --> 00:10:27,805
So is our ability to dig
through your memories,

153
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,322
but I'd rather save the time.

154
00:10:29,347 --> 00:10:31,017
What do you want?

155
00:10:31,042 --> 00:10:33,346
First, I'll need assurances.

156
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,067
Sanctum is mine.

157
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,935
We destroy the stone.

158
00:10:38,174 --> 00:10:40,475
You people never come back.

159
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:43,808
The stones are indestructible,

160
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,934
but, yes, you can have Sanctum,

161
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,503
not that it'll matter.

162
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:53,417
I don't think you
comprehend what this means.

163
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:56,727
It means someone has memories
that are not their own,

164
00:10:56,752 --> 00:10:59,790
memories that you require
in order to start a war

165
00:10:59,815 --> 00:11:02,416
with whoever made the stones,

166
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,807
a war I want no part of.

167
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:08,186
One planet will be fine,
thank you very much.

168
00:11:08,211 --> 00:11:10,664
Not a war, the last war,

169
00:11:10,957 --> 00:11:13,648
and you'll be part of it
whether you like it or not.

170
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,462
How's that?

171
00:11:15,701 --> 00:11:18,001
If we win, we transcend,

172
00:11:18,282 --> 00:11:22,093
evolving beyond these meat
sacks that age and die,

173
00:11:22,118 --> 00:11:25,039
becoming one with a
universal consciousness.

174
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,709
I like this meat sack. It's new.

175
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:30,847
- This will be better.
- Hmm.

176
00:11:30,872 --> 00:11:34,158
And whether you fight with us or not,

177
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,291
even you will transcend.

178
00:11:37,316 --> 00:11:39,330
Every member of the human family will.

179
00:11:39,608 --> 00:11:41,362
Good luck with that.

180
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,869
Do we have a deal or not?

181
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,569
You fool.

182
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,716
If we lose, it won't
matter what planet you're on

183
00:11:49,741 --> 00:11:51,465
or whether you're fighting.

184
00:11:51,738 --> 00:11:54,673
Every member of the human family dies.

185
00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:00,652
Clarke's child.

186
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:05,151
Madi.

187
00:12:05,176 --> 00:12:07,124
Of course. Bellamy knew.

188
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,540
That's why she killed him.

189
00:12:08,565 --> 00:12:09,931
Thank you.

190
00:12:13,856 --> 00:12:16,724
She'll never
let you take her child.

191
00:12:16,859 --> 00:12:18,359
I won't be asking.

192
00:12:18,384 --> 00:12:21,508
Of course not. You'll send
a strike team no doubt,

193
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,241
they'll fight you, the child, as well.

194
00:12:23,266 --> 00:12:25,767
If she gets killed, you'll have nothing.

195
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,401
- You have a better idea?
- Yes.

196
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:33,807
Send me.

197
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,293
- You?
- Mmm.

198
00:12:42,318 --> 00:12:43,751
Who wants no part of this.

199
00:12:43,886 --> 00:12:46,550
That was before I
knew what was at stake.

200
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:50,991
Although transcend or
die has a nice ring to it,

201
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:55,381
it really isn't much of a choice, is it?

202
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,292
I've been in the child's head.

203
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:03,331
I know her better
that she knows herself.

204
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,551
How well does your strike team know her?

205
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:11,380
I'll get her back, but
then our deal still stands.

206
00:13:18,645 --> 00:13:20,277
Take him to the bridge.

207
00:13:31,993 --> 00:13:34,193
I don't want to take inventory.

208
00:13:35,654 --> 00:13:37,821
So don't.

209
00:13:37,846 --> 00:13:39,345
We took everything we could carry

210
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,136
when we marched for the valley.

211
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,265
Do your remember our first
night in our desert tent?

212
00:13:51,092 --> 00:13:52,558
Hey. You OK?

213
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:55,332
I told Bellamy I'd forgive him.

214
00:13:56,508 --> 00:13:58,141
Now I can't.

215
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,243
Talk to me.

216
00:14:08,298 --> 00:14:11,332
He forgave me for everything I did here.

217
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,425
I wonder if my father would do that.

218
00:14:17,091 --> 00:14:19,247
I don't think he would.

219
00:14:20,636 --> 00:14:23,215
Your father wanted you to live, Nate.

220
00:14:24,088 --> 00:14:26,850
That's why he gave up
his spot in this bunker,

221
00:14:28,112 --> 00:14:29,810
and you have.

222
00:14:30,298 --> 00:14:32,051
You are.

223
00:14:35,337 --> 00:14:37,146
Clarke's right.

224
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:41,967
Everyone we care about
that's left is here.

225
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:47,364
We thought Sanctum was
our second chance...

226
00:14:48,381 --> 00:14:50,514
but I think this is.

227
00:14:56,782 --> 00:14:58,882
Welcome to Niylah's rec room.

228
00:14:58,923 --> 00:15:02,142
No cursing, no spitting, no killing.

229
00:15:04,287 --> 00:15:08,155
Huh. No way. A piano.

230
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,172
I used to tickle the ivories.

231
00:15:10,197 --> 00:15:11,188
Jordan, hold this.

232
00:15:11,213 --> 00:15:13,203
It's been over 200 years, but, uh...

233
00:15:14,403 --> 00:15:16,103
Out of tune.

234
00:15:16,622 --> 00:15:18,688
What are you doing?

235
00:15:18,824 --> 00:15:22,692
Ohh. There were too many
rules when we lived here.

236
00:15:22,938 --> 00:15:26,006
I found my way around most of them.

237
00:15:31,947 --> 00:15:35,159
- The bar's open.
- Ahh. Is it safe?

238
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,984
It was never safe.

239
00:15:42,264 --> 00:15:44,506
God, that's awful.

240
00:15:44,947 --> 00:15:47,248
It was your dad's recipe.

241
00:16:01,241 --> 00:16:02,808
Smooth.

242
00:16:06,338 --> 00:16:07,926
Echo.

243
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,875
I'm tired.

244
00:16:23,514 --> 00:16:26,149
- I'll go with you.
- No.

245
00:16:26,992 --> 00:16:27,992
I'm gonna.

246
00:16:28,017 --> 00:16:29,181
She needs space.

247
00:16:29,206 --> 00:16:31,906
And we need to drink.

248
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:36,816
Oh. No, no, thank you.

249
00:16:37,235 --> 00:16:39,348
I'm tired, too.

250
00:16:39,674 --> 00:16:41,574
My dad made it.

251
00:16:46,445 --> 00:16:49,746
OK. Hmm.

252
00:16:51,116 --> 00:16:52,716
- Oh, my...
- Ha ha ha!

253
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,821
- It's good, right?
- No. That's awful. Mmm.

254
00:16:57,956 --> 00:16:59,990
Oh, man.

255
00:17:02,785 --> 00:17:05,887
This'll do until we can
rebuild above ground.

256
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:12,319
Pick a bed. You'll be less
mad at me in the morning.

257
00:17:15,491 --> 00:17:17,458
All these beds should
be filled with people.

258
00:17:17,483 --> 00:17:21,544
Oh, Madi, I'm really
not in the mood to argue.

259
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,985
You decided for me...

260
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:33,128
again.

261
00:17:35,564 --> 00:17:37,731
I decided for everyone.

262
00:17:38,226 --> 00:17:40,112
That's what I do.

263
00:17:41,358 --> 00:17:44,826
Just like you decided to kill Bellamy.

264
00:17:47,072 --> 00:17:48,905
I did that to save you.

265
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,874
I didn't ask you to,

266
00:17:51,476 --> 00:17:53,170
and now you have to live with that!

267
00:17:53,394 --> 00:17:55,293
I don't want that for you!

268
00:17:56,634 --> 00:17:59,301
I know you're mad that
I stranded us here,

269
00:17:59,944 --> 00:18:02,752
but remember Shallow Valley,

270
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:06,052
when it was just us and all we
wanted was for our friends...

271
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:09,613
Your friends. What about mine?

272
00:18:09,638 --> 00:18:11,282
I was starting to build my own life.

273
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:13,391
I have friends in Sanctum.

274
00:18:13,462 --> 00:18:15,977
Picasso is there, Luca.

275
00:18:16,002 --> 00:18:18,024
You think you're protecting me,

276
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:19,406
but you're not.

277
00:18:20,495 --> 00:18:22,562
You ruined my life.

278
00:18:23,928 --> 00:18:25,761
Just like you ruined your own.

279
00:18:28,082 --> 00:18:30,157
Madi, wait.

280
00:18:30,447 --> 00:18:33,360
This place is huge. You can't
just wander off in the dark.

281
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:40,023
I won't. Don't follow me.

282
00:18:49,371 --> 00:18:51,871
Oh, let there be light.

283
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,191
That's my girl.

284
00:18:59,755 --> 00:19:01,398
Well, thanks for your help.

285
00:19:01,423 --> 00:19:02,979
Now we find the stone,

286
00:19:03,004 --> 00:19:04,203
assuming you can fix this.

287
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:05,725
You're kidding, right?

288
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,117
I'm not a miracle worker, Murphy.

289
00:19:07,252 --> 00:19:08,551
I beg to differ.

290
00:19:08,576 --> 00:19:10,973
Come one. You know we can't
leave all those people on Sanctum

291
00:19:10,997 --> 00:19:13,260
now that we know it's survivable here.

292
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,718
The people on Sanctum
are better off without us.

293
00:19:15,743 --> 00:19:17,815
Until the next eclipse maybe.

294
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,108
Clarke is wrong.

295
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:21,146
Some of those people
are from here, Raven,

296
00:19:21,171 --> 00:19:22,819
Wonkru, Eligius prisoners.

297
00:19:22,844 --> 00:19:24,744
Earth is their home, too.

298
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,805
Let me ask you something.

299
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:29,319
When you let hatch and his buddies die,

300
00:19:29,344 --> 00:19:31,378
was that just to save your friends?

301
00:19:35,668 --> 00:19:38,191
We passed a workshop down here.

302
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:41,992
6 years of watching Bellamy
manipulate her on the ring.

303
00:19:46,082 --> 00:19:47,684
Damn it.

304
00:19:48,513 --> 00:19:50,080
I know.

305
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,763
I miss him, too.

306
00:19:56,706 --> 00:19:58,287
Yeah.

307
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:02,007
_

308
00:20:03,857 --> 00:20:05,745
_

309
00:20:07,983 --> 00:20:10,420
_

310
00:20:12,872 --> 00:20:14,808
_

311
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,832
_

312
00:20:20,825 --> 00:20:22,958
Did Lincoln teach you that?

313
00:20:27,912 --> 00:20:29,705
You weren't my only teacher.

314
00:20:30,531 --> 00:20:34,237
No. Just the best.

315
00:20:37,368 --> 00:20:40,269
It's your watch in the rotunda.

316
00:20:42,226 --> 00:20:45,815
No way. I'm not going back down there.

317
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,773
Fine.

318
00:20:49,036 --> 00:20:51,087
Then neither am I.

319
00:20:53,397 --> 00:20:55,199
I told you once

320
00:20:55,376 --> 00:20:57,810
we mourn the dead when the war is over.

321
00:20:58,463 --> 00:21:00,004
So is it over?

322
00:21:01,488 --> 00:21:03,521
I hope so.

323
00:21:06,107 --> 00:21:08,471
I saw you days ago, but for you,

324
00:21:08,496 --> 00:21:11,010
it's been 10 years on another planet,

325
00:21:11,035 --> 00:21:12,986
yet still you haven't made peace

326
00:21:13,011 --> 00:21:14,654
with what happened here.

327
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:16,255
I thought I did.

328
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:20,126
And then seeing the fighting pit again,

329
00:21:20,307 --> 00:21:21,907
I don't know.

330
00:21:23,107 --> 00:21:26,189
We did what we had to do to survive,

331
00:21:26,775 --> 00:21:31,156
but if it is your penance to sit here

332
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:33,393
in the freezing cold,

333
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:35,108
then it is my penance, too,

334
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,595
because I am equally guilty

335
00:21:37,691 --> 00:21:39,891
about what happened down there.

336
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:43,112
We were all Blodreina.

337
00:21:54,348 --> 00:21:57,704
Now come on. We'll face
your demons together.

338
00:22:04,436 --> 00:22:05,969
You win.

339
00:22:30,733 --> 00:22:33,574
Conclave rules. Conclave rules.

340
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,001
Win the fight, save your life.

341
00:22:55,473 --> 00:22:57,593
I used to resent when you
would look at her like that.

342
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:00,443
- Gaia.
- I don't anymore.

343
00:23:01,956 --> 00:23:04,505
I am glad Octavia came to you.

344
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,897
She was always more warrior than I.

345
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:09,727
I am sorry that I wasn't.

346
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:13,315
I'm the one who's sorry.

347
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:17,026
My child, don't you know?

348
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:20,797
You're my Seda.

349
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:26,602
Here they come!

350
00:23:27,747 --> 00:23:29,013
On me!

351
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:30,940
Gaia!

352
00:23:44,975 --> 00:23:47,867
What was that? Why open
the bridge and not use it?

353
00:23:48,018 --> 00:23:52,120
They used it. Someone's here.

354
00:23:53,171 --> 00:23:54,908
I can feel it.

355
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,538
They're here for Madi.

356
00:23:56,563 --> 00:23:57,626
Go warn Clarke.

357
00:23:57,651 --> 00:23:59,696
I'll stay and make sure
no one else comes through.

358
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:01,755
I'm not leaving you again.

359
00:24:02,151 --> 00:24:03,917
I'll go.

360
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,979
They're here for Madi.

361
00:24:43,057 --> 00:24:44,882
Where is she?

362
00:24:45,426 --> 00:24:47,126
We had a fight.

363
00:24:49,954 --> 00:24:51,554
I have to find her.

364
00:24:55,789 --> 00:24:56,789
Madi!

365
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:09,138
Hey. I like that song.

366
00:25:14,626 --> 00:25:16,451
What? No.

367
00:25:21,418 --> 00:25:23,051
Um...

368
00:25:26,244 --> 00:25:28,277
I'm... I'm sorry. I...

369
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:36,666
This is the part where
you go after her, mi hermano.

370
00:25:40,577 --> 00:25:42,489
Hi, Madi.

371
00:25:43,138 --> 00:25:45,038
Madi's here?

372
00:25:46,976 --> 00:25:48,619
Ohh.

373
00:25:49,351 --> 00:25:51,184
There she is.

374
00:25:55,149 --> 00:25:57,449
It's OK, Niylah. You
can drink in front of me.

375
00:25:57,474 --> 00:25:59,641
Uh, she's had enough anyway.

376
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:03,123
What? I'm fine.

377
00:26:03,148 --> 00:26:04,581
Madi?

378
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:07,063
If you can hear me...

379
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,607
She wasn't on level 6 either.

380
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:15,204
There's 4 more levels. We'll find her.

381
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:17,654
OK.

382
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,719
The party's over.

383
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:33,089
Grownups.

384
00:26:38,529 --> 00:26:40,667
Will you play something else?

385
00:26:41,048 --> 00:26:44,901
Ahh. I'll do better than that.

386
00:26:44,926 --> 00:26:48,094
Have a seat. I'll teach you.

387
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:50,720
- Really?
- Yeah. It's easy.

388
00:26:50,788 --> 00:26:54,924
It's only taken me 200
years to figure out.

389
00:26:54,949 --> 00:26:56,449
Madi?

390
00:26:58,498 --> 00:26:59,963
Answer me!

391
00:26:59,988 --> 00:27:02,722
Hands like this. OK.

392
00:27:06,213 --> 00:27:07,846
We're gonna play a C.

393
00:27:10,478 --> 00:27:11,844
Madi!

394
00:27:25,363 --> 00:27:26,829
You're drunk.

395
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:29,986
And you said you were tired,

396
00:27:30,011 --> 00:27:32,304
but you're still up, so...

397
00:27:37,518 --> 00:27:39,923
Why are you still up, Echo?

398
00:27:40,211 --> 00:27:41,644
Not Echo.

399
00:27:43,786 --> 00:27:45,185
Ash.

400
00:27:47,795 --> 00:27:49,829
My name is Ash.

401
00:27:49,965 --> 00:27:52,899
Don't worry. I never
told Bellamy either.

402
00:27:54,073 --> 00:27:55,506
6 years,

403
00:27:55,704 --> 00:27:58,340
and I never told him my real name.

404
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:01,986
Every day, I'd wake
up and think to myself

405
00:28:02,256 --> 00:28:04,089
"today's the day."

406
00:28:06,037 --> 00:28:07,474
But no.

407
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,492
When I finally told someone,

408
00:28:10,835 --> 00:28:12,769
it was to save my life.

409
00:28:15,628 --> 00:28:17,862
Echo was a coward.

410
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:20,416
No.

411
00:28:22,948 --> 00:28:27,417
Not a coward. Human.

412
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,834
I wanted him to see me as
this person I've become,

413
00:28:33,103 --> 00:28:37,316
not pity me for who I was
or what I went through or...

414
00:28:37,396 --> 00:28:40,291
He did. He wouldn't have
stayed with you that long

415
00:28:40,316 --> 00:28:42,736
if he couldn't see the real you, Echo.

416
00:28:53,928 --> 00:28:55,673
I mean Ash.

417
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:00,573
You're not the only one with secrets.

418
00:29:01,628 --> 00:29:03,954
I was named for Queen Nia.

419
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:08,207
What? But you're Trikru.

420
00:29:08,311 --> 00:29:10,430
My father's side.

421
00:29:11,747 --> 00:29:13,680
My mother was Azgeda.

422
00:29:13,739 --> 00:29:16,384
That's why we lived so
far out in the woods.

423
00:29:18,639 --> 00:29:21,173
So no one would see her scars.

424
00:29:26,088 --> 00:29:28,333
We are who we choose to be,

425
00:29:29,446 --> 00:29:32,121
and we don't owe anyone our pain.

426
00:29:39,592 --> 00:29:41,892
What is taking you so long?

427
00:29:45,403 --> 00:29:47,703
Miracles take time.

428
00:29:48,181 --> 00:29:51,149
Hero Murphy's kind of freaking me out.

429
00:29:51,174 --> 00:29:52,792
I know...

430
00:29:54,013 --> 00:29:55,680
But it's hot.

431
00:29:56,157 --> 00:29:58,267
I'm right here, and also I'm not a hero.

432
00:29:58,292 --> 00:30:00,816
I just think the people on
Sanctum deserve to live on a planet

433
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:04,253
that doesn't eat them or
occasionally drive them insane.

434
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:24,717
Hey.

435
00:30:24,742 --> 00:30:28,498
We haven't, uh, properly met. I am...

436
00:30:28,523 --> 00:30:30,080
John Murphy.

437
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:32,558
I've heard stories.

438
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:34,116
I tend to play well in stories.

439
00:30:34,141 --> 00:30:37,179
Hmm. Not these.

440
00:30:37,778 --> 00:30:40,846
Those stories. Yes.

441
00:30:42,915 --> 00:30:44,915
You OK?

442
00:30:46,164 --> 00:30:48,464
Hey, Murphy.

443
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:51,367
I... got this.

444
00:30:53,584 --> 00:30:56,972
OK. I was his favorite, though,

445
00:30:57,361 --> 00:30:59,127
wasn't I, Jordan?

446
00:31:03,536 --> 00:31:06,019
I am sorry I upset you.

447
00:31:06,154 --> 00:31:08,884
I haven't spent a lot of
time with people, and...

448
00:31:09,923 --> 00:31:12,435
sometimes I just misread things.

449
00:31:12,658 --> 00:31:14,825
Yeah. Me, too.

450
00:31:29,073 --> 00:31:30,449
I was having fun dancing,

451
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:32,783
- and I thought you...
- I was.

452
00:31:33,722 --> 00:31:36,093
I just started to feel guilty.

453
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,435
I know.

454
00:31:40,661 --> 00:31:42,655
I felt the same when I woke from cryo

455
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,647
and my parents were gone.

456
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:48,790
It takes time, but it does get easier.

457
00:31:56,912 --> 00:31:58,101
We should get back.

458
00:31:58,126 --> 00:31:59,466
You don't have to dance if you...

459
00:31:59,491 --> 00:32:01,410
You know, let's dance here.

460
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:04,010
- There's no music.
- Mmm.

461
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:14,728
OK.

462
00:32:18,756 --> 00:32:20,289
OK.

463
00:32:28,722 --> 00:32:32,190
Madi, where are you?

464
00:32:32,215 --> 00:32:34,481
Madi! Madi!

465
00:32:34,506 --> 00:32:35,906
- Clarke?
- Hey, hey. What?

466
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:37,196
Whoa, whoa. What happened?

467
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,088
Is Madi with you?

468
00:32:39,553 --> 00:32:42,021
Did you fix it? I
need to find the stone.

469
00:32:42,308 --> 00:32:45,214
Oh, now you
want to find the stone?

470
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,937
I'm sorry, Murphy. You were right.

471
00:32:47,962 --> 00:32:49,161
We need to leave.

472
00:32:49,186 --> 00:32:51,073
Why? What happened?

473
00:32:51,098 --> 00:32:52,661
Disciples are after Madi.

474
00:32:52,686 --> 00:32:54,133
Has anyone seen her?

475
00:32:54,158 --> 00:32:56,125
She's in the rec room.

476
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,661
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

477
00:33:01,977 --> 00:33:05,211
No, no, no. No, no!

478
00:33:05,236 --> 00:33:06,769
Madi!

479
00:33:07,805 --> 00:33:08,971
Madi!

480
00:33:08,996 --> 00:33:13,365
E, E, F, G.

481
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,390
Yeah. It's that easy.

482
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:18,358
It's only 5 notes, but...

483
00:33:18,765 --> 00:33:21,771
yeah, it almost feels... Familiar.

484
00:33:21,796 --> 00:33:25,631
Hmm. That is the
beauty of Mr. Beethoven.

485
00:33:25,846 --> 00:33:29,381
OK. Try again, but this time, I want...

486
00:33:52,877 --> 00:33:54,595
Help! Get away from me!

487
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,878
Hello, Madi.

488
00:34:07,314 --> 00:34:11,997
It seems you're the key to the
transcendence of the human race.

489
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,587
They sent me to bring you back,

490
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,800
but, you see,

491
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:21,158
I don't want to transcend.

492
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:24,040
I want to reign.

493
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,680
They gave me a choice...

494
00:34:26,816 --> 00:34:31,418
Use these to bring you back peacefully

495
00:34:31,554 --> 00:34:33,103
or this...

496
00:34:34,467 --> 00:34:36,818
if you wouldn't go willingly.

497
00:34:39,233 --> 00:34:42,101
I prefer option 3...

498
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:47,046
to gut you like a pig.

499
00:34:50,618 --> 00:34:51,984
Go!

500
00:34:53,477 --> 00:34:56,044
Indra's in the rotunda. Get help!

501
00:35:01,414 --> 00:35:03,681
Help! Clarke!

502
00:35:06,782 --> 00:35:08,448
Help!

503
00:35:08,791 --> 00:35:11,325
Gaia, Indra!

504
00:35:11,452 --> 00:35:12,751
Do you hear that?

505
00:35:12,776 --> 00:35:15,043
- Help!
- It sounds like Madi.

506
00:35:17,066 --> 00:35:20,657
- We let them in. On me.
- Gabriel needs help!

507
00:35:22,271 --> 00:35:23,604
- Madi?
- He's here!

508
00:35:23,739 --> 00:35:26,740
- Madi, what is it?
- Help! No!

509
00:35:28,999 --> 00:35:29,999
You.

510
00:35:30,146 --> 00:35:31,779
Me.

511
00:35:34,795 --> 00:35:35,795
Us.

512
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,586
Madi, clear out.

513
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,809
_

514
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:12,853
Not today.

515
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:30,595
Murphy, give it up.

516
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,922
It's never gonna break.

517
00:36:35,021 --> 00:36:36,666
You were saying?

518
00:36:36,699 --> 00:36:37,887
Nice job, Murphy.

519
00:36:37,912 --> 00:36:39,707
All in a day's work, my friends.

520
00:36:39,732 --> 00:36:42,033
Thanks, Murphy.
All right. Let's go.

521
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:54,819
Gabriel.

522
00:36:54,844 --> 00:36:57,211
Gabriel. No, no, no, no.

523
00:36:59,952 --> 00:37:02,120
Hope... my friend.

524
00:37:02,145 --> 00:37:04,955
I'm right here. I'm with you.

525
00:37:05,383 --> 00:37:06,796
Where is she?

526
00:37:07,603 --> 00:37:08,803
Madi.

527
00:37:11,427 --> 00:37:12,661
Sheidheda.

528
00:37:14,819 --> 00:37:16,422
I tried.

529
00:37:17,406 --> 00:37:19,168
I'm right here.

530
00:37:19,927 --> 00:37:23,029
Thank God. Are you hurt?

531
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,385
He saved my life.

532
00:37:29,382 --> 00:37:31,453
Sheidheda got away.

533
00:37:31,848 --> 00:37:35,005
He stabbed himself in the gut and...

534
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,514
disappeared.

535
00:37:37,434 --> 00:37:39,398
I know how that works.

536
00:37:39,748 --> 00:37:41,714
Cadogan will send more disciples.

537
00:37:41,863 --> 00:37:44,259
We have to get
back to Sanctum now.

538
00:37:44,504 --> 00:37:46,323
The stone.

539
00:37:46,938 --> 00:37:48,071
Find the stone.

540
00:37:48,096 --> 00:37:49,511
I couldn't fix the helmet.

541
00:37:49,633 --> 00:37:52,033
Sheidheda's. He left it.

542
00:37:58,441 --> 00:37:59,529
It's damaged.

543
00:37:59,554 --> 00:38:02,120
It can't pinpoint the exact location.

544
00:38:04,473 --> 00:38:05,939
The stone's here.

545
00:38:07,835 --> 00:38:09,435
What'd we miss?

546
00:38:12,688 --> 00:38:14,911
- Tell me what happened.
- I don't know.

547
00:38:15,712 --> 00:38:18,437
No. No, no, no, no.

548
00:38:18,804 --> 00:38:20,637
I'm ready.

549
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:24,242
What do you mean
the stone's here? Where?

550
00:38:24,598 --> 00:38:25,777
I don't know.

551
00:38:26,047 --> 00:38:27,280
We find it,

552
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,573
we go back to Sanctum, we get our army.

553
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:32,874
Clarke, you're
not going to war over me.

554
00:38:33,336 --> 00:38:36,098
If they try to take you, I am.

555
00:38:36,123 --> 00:38:37,756
All of us are.

556
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:44,194
No one else is getting
killed trying to protect me.

557
00:38:50,592 --> 00:38:51,880
Madi!

558
00:38:52,761 --> 00:38:55,314
- Maybe I should just...
- Absolutely not.

559
00:38:57,073 --> 00:38:58,576
Do something!

560
00:38:58,708 --> 00:39:02,176
Hope, I want this. It's OK.

561
00:39:03,996 --> 00:39:06,170
In peace, may
you leave this shore.

562
00:39:06,195 --> 00:39:07,814
In love...

563
00:39:08,278 --> 00:39:09,444
No.

564
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:11,644
May you find the next.

565
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:14,550
Safe passage on your travels

566
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:18,597
until our final journey on the ground.

567
00:39:19,027 --> 00:39:20,868
_

568
00:39:20,934 --> 00:39:22,000
May we meet again.

569
00:39:22,025 --> 00:39:23,958
May we meet again.

570
00:39:31,668 --> 00:39:33,134
God!

571
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:42,003
Madi?

572
00:39:43,076 --> 00:39:44,909
Madi?!

573
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,683
The vent.

574
00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:49,040
What?

575
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:57,625
Raven, Murphy, find that stone!

576
00:39:58,032 --> 00:40:00,426
Madi, put the knife down.

577
00:40:00,451 --> 00:40:02,217
Don't take another step.

578
00:40:03,371 --> 00:40:04,887
I am sorry.

579
00:40:04,912 --> 00:40:07,442
I did not know what she
wanted until it was too late.

580
00:40:07,467 --> 00:40:10,126
Octavia said Cadogan would
just keep sending more people

581
00:40:10,151 --> 00:40:11,249
until he gets me.

582
00:40:11,274 --> 00:40:13,208
No one will ever be safe.

583
00:40:13,414 --> 00:40:15,581
Madi, please don't do this.

584
00:40:15,857 --> 00:40:18,865
I told you no one
else is dying to save me.

585
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:22,392
Madi... please.

586
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:24,749
I love you, Clarke.

587
00:40:24,939 --> 00:40:26,473
No!

588
00:40:35,354 --> 00:40:36,703
_

589
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:40,268
Be prepared!

590
00:40:40,562 --> 00:40:42,095
They'll be invisible.

591
00:40:47,777 --> 00:40:49,235
Bomb!

592
00:41:17,657 --> 00:41:19,424
What the hell was that?

593
00:41:30,776 --> 00:41:32,408
Emori, it was nothing. Come back.

594
00:41:32,433 --> 00:41:34,366
Quiet. Listen.

595
00:41:45,277 --> 00:41:50,277
