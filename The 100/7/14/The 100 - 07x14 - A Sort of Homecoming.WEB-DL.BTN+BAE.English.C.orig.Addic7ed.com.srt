1
00:00:00,905 --> 00:00:02,324
Previously on "The 100"...

2
00:00:02,349 --> 00:00:04,222
Where the hell is my daughter?

3
00:00:04,247 --> 00:00:06,590
We didn't know she was
missing until today.

4
00:00:06,615 --> 00:00:07,748
Nobody did.

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,467
We're gonna get everyone back.

6
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:12,190
I remember things.

7
00:00:12,215 --> 00:00:13,381
Your sketchbook?

8
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,999
Madi, don't tell anyone that...

9
00:00:17,035 --> 00:00:18,235
ever.

10
00:00:18,402 --> 00:00:20,569
We need to get to our friends.

11
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:27,412
There's your bridge. Go.

12
00:00:27,437 --> 00:00:28,803
You're coming with us.

13
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:30,140
Now move.

14
00:00:30,283 --> 00:00:33,051
You should have more faith, Clarke.

15
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:34,809
My throne.

16
00:00:35,448 --> 00:00:36,617
The book.

17
00:00:41,885 --> 00:00:42,876
Bellamy...

18
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:44,202
_

19
00:00:44,766 --> 00:00:46,465
Don't make me do this.

20
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,368
The fate of the entire
human race is at stake.

21
00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:51,726
I have no choice but to share this.

22
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:53,050
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:54,574
Me, too.

24
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:23,325
Clarke!

25
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:27,240
What is it? What happened?

26
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,049
Where are we?

27
00:01:32,194 --> 00:01:34,027
The Second Dawn bunker.

28
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:36,363
Otherwise known as hell.

29
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:37,988
Earth?

30
00:01:40,135 --> 00:01:41,401
How?

31
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:44,070
This place is perfect for you.

32
00:01:48,143 --> 00:01:50,110
Nano-tracking program.

33
00:01:52,614 --> 00:01:55,782
What is it you say? May we meet again.

34
00:02:02,557 --> 00:02:04,457
Welcome home, Mother.

35
00:02:05,977 --> 00:02:07,477
Gaia?

36
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,144
Seda, how are you here?

37
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:29,233
Good question.

38
00:02:30,852 --> 00:02:32,786
He turned off the stone.

39
00:02:32,921 --> 00:02:35,757
Before the bridge
closed, we went through...

40
00:02:37,763 --> 00:02:39,897
Landing here.

41
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:44,764
No. How?

42
00:02:44,884 --> 00:02:46,216
The closing bridge defaults

43
00:02:46,241 --> 00:02:48,508
to the planetary origin of our DNA.

44
00:02:48,643 --> 00:02:50,376
Your journey ends here, too.

45
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:52,490
He would not stop
talking while we fought.

46
00:02:52,514 --> 00:02:54,533
He said when you're
caught in a closing bridge,

47
00:02:54,558 --> 00:02:57,240
it defaults to the
planetary origin of your DNA,

48
00:02:57,265 --> 00:02:58,351
Earth.

49
00:02:58,376 --> 00:02:59,575
For all mankind.

50
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,912
I'm no man.

51
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,832
Where's the head?

52
00:03:12,968 --> 00:03:14,901
Buried with the rest of him.

53
00:03:15,036 --> 00:03:17,837
Until today, no one even
knew you were missing.

54
00:03:18,211 --> 00:03:19,853
How long have you been alone here?

55
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:23,276
A few days until the
others arrived this morning.

56
00:03:23,522 --> 00:03:25,956
I thought it would be
the rest of my life.

57
00:03:25,981 --> 00:03:27,614
We're together now.

58
00:03:30,452 --> 00:03:32,515
Echo and Octavia...

59
00:03:33,364 --> 00:03:34,896
where are they?

60
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,414
It's so green.

61
00:03:52,073 --> 00:03:53,473
They're over here.

62
00:03:56,231 --> 00:03:58,064
Earth is back.

63
00:04:07,633 --> 00:04:08,732
Hey.

64
00:04:08,757 --> 00:04:11,257
- Jax!
- Hey, baby.

65
00:04:11,282 --> 00:04:13,315
Oh, it's good to see you.

66
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:14,661
I missed you.

67
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,729
- Hey.
- Hi.

68
00:04:16,865 --> 00:04:19,766
- Hey!
- Hey.

69
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,858
It's good to see you.

70
00:04:22,103 --> 00:04:23,736
Hi.

71
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:25,004
You weren't inside.

72
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,873
- Hey.
- Hey.

73
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:30,749
Where's Bellamy?

74
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,483
Clarke?

75
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:41,999
Dead.

76
00:04:44,693 --> 00:04:46,426
He's dead.

77
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:47,727
Bellamy?

78
00:04:47,892 --> 00:04:49,425
Clarke, he was fine when we left.

79
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,148
- I'm a little confu...
- I killed him.

80
00:05:04,036 --> 00:05:05,739
I had to.

81
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,847
Why?

82
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:14,901
Madi's sketchbook. He had it,

83
00:05:14,926 --> 00:05:19,569
and he knew that she still has
the memories of the Commander.

84
00:05:19,773 --> 00:05:22,841
She would never be safe.

85
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:25,203
I begged him to stop.

86
00:05:26,055 --> 00:05:27,964
I tried to get the book back,

87
00:05:27,989 --> 00:05:29,624
but he...

88
00:05:30,648 --> 00:05:32,707
I tried everything, I promise.

89
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,364
I tried.

90
00:05:37,445 --> 00:05:39,445
I'm so sorry.

91
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,257
I understand.

92
00:05:54,329 --> 00:05:56,229
So would the old Bellamy.

93
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,945
The one that would do
anything for his baby sister

94
00:06:02,206 --> 00:06:04,606
and the people he loved.

95
00:06:13,434 --> 00:06:16,230
You can hate me if you want to.

96
00:06:17,179 --> 00:06:19,346
God knows I do.

97
00:06:24,445 --> 00:06:26,794
We lost him a long time ago.

98
00:06:27,445 --> 00:06:30,421
He needed all this chaos to make sense,

99
00:06:31,302 --> 00:06:32,832
all the violence,

100
00:06:33,055 --> 00:06:35,771
all the people we've killed.

101
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:39,872
He couldn't accept that
it's all meaningless.

102
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:41,885
Cadogan gave him meaning,

103
00:06:42,131 --> 00:06:45,032
and that meaning is what killed him...

104
00:06:46,975 --> 00:06:48,608
Not you.

105
00:07:42,513 --> 00:07:44,647
No one wants to live here,

106
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,916
but it will do until we
build our own shelter.

107
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:48,378
There is a river close by,

108
00:07:48,403 --> 00:07:50,847
so there is plenty of drinking water.

109
00:07:51,723 --> 00:07:54,457
What about food? You
check the hydrofarm?

110
00:07:54,482 --> 00:07:55,537
Nothing.

111
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:58,563
That whole level was
destroyed in the fire.

112
00:07:59,387 --> 00:08:01,387
Where is Blodreina?

113
00:08:02,743 --> 00:08:04,276
She didn't come back inside.

114
00:08:04,435 --> 00:08:06,202
Avoiding her demons.

115
00:08:06,337 --> 00:08:07,770
I don't blame her.

116
00:08:07,795 --> 00:08:09,515
Have you found another food source?

117
00:08:09,564 --> 00:08:11,330
We hear birds, insects, so there must...

118
00:08:11,466 --> 00:08:13,789
What about power, hot water?

119
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:16,418
That's it. I'm out of here.

120
00:08:16,443 --> 00:08:17,904
Where's the funky ball
with the green light?

121
00:08:17,928 --> 00:08:19,790
A way out is the first
thing we looked for.

122
00:08:19,814 --> 00:08:21,917
There's no stone here.

123
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,334
No. There has to be.

124
00:08:23,494 --> 00:08:25,293
That's how Cadogan got his people out.

125
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,446
We lived here for 6 years.

126
00:08:27,693 --> 00:08:29,092
I think we would have seen it.

127
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:30,683
One way to find out.

128
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,378
Raven, we tried that.

129
00:08:34,403 --> 00:08:36,870
Our helmets showed no
trace of the stone anywhere.

130
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:42,171
100 feet straight down.

131
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:44,607
They gave you trash helmets
so you couldn't get out.

132
00:08:44,632 --> 00:08:46,414
Perfect. So we jump to Sanctum,

133
00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:49,022
have a hot shower, stock up on supplies.

134
00:08:49,047 --> 00:08:50,986
Bring my people home.

135
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,540
- Raven, can I?
- Yeah.

136
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,773
What the hell are you doing?

137
00:09:04,018 --> 00:09:06,419
It's the only way out of here!

138
00:09:06,554 --> 00:09:09,021
Earth is our home.

139
00:09:09,236 --> 00:09:12,170
Everyone who is from here is here...

140
00:09:13,271 --> 00:09:15,415
Everyone we care about,

141
00:09:16,053 --> 00:09:18,854
and I will not lose anyone else.

142
00:09:21,903 --> 00:09:23,602
Let's choose a room.

143
00:09:51,062 --> 00:09:53,829
Pretty pictures, don't you think?

144
00:09:56,414 --> 00:09:58,814
These restraints won't do at all.

145
00:10:00,886 --> 00:10:02,666
You're lucky my people brought you here,

146
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:05,154
or you'd be dead right now.

147
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:06,946
I feel lucky.

148
00:10:10,752 --> 00:10:12,785
Did you draw this?

149
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,761
No... but I know who did.

150
00:10:19,394 --> 00:10:22,582
Ohh. Incredible.

151
00:10:22,607 --> 00:10:25,102
Yes. Our medicine is incredible.

152
00:10:25,127 --> 00:10:27,690
So is our ability to dig
through your memories,

153
00:10:27,715 --> 00:10:29,207
but I'd rather save the time.

154
00:10:29,232 --> 00:10:30,902
What do you want?

155
00:10:30,927 --> 00:10:33,231
First, I'll need assurances.

156
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:35,952
Sanctum is mine.

157
00:10:36,087 --> 00:10:37,820
We destroy the stone.

158
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:40,360
You people never come back.

159
00:10:41,994 --> 00:10:43,693
The stones are indestructible,

160
00:10:43,718 --> 00:10:46,819
but, yes, you can have Sanctum,

161
00:10:46,844 --> 00:10:49,388
not that it'll matter.

162
00:10:49,634 --> 00:10:53,302
I don't think you
comprehend what this means.

163
00:10:53,438 --> 00:10:56,612
It means someone has memories
that are not their own,

164
00:10:56,637 --> 00:10:59,675
memories that you require
in order to start a war

165
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,301
with whoever made the stones,

166
00:11:02,547 --> 00:11:04,692
a war I want no part of.

167
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,071
One planet will be fine,
thank you very much.

168
00:11:08,096 --> 00:11:10,549
Not a war, the last war,

169
00:11:10,842 --> 00:11:13,533
and you'll be part of it
whether you like it or not.

170
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:15,347
How's that?

171
00:11:15,586 --> 00:11:17,886
If we win, we transcend,

172
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:21,978
evolving beyond these meat
sacks that age and die,

173
00:11:22,003 --> 00:11:24,924
becoming one with a
universal consciousness.

174
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,594
I like this meat sack. It's new.

175
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,732
- This will be better.
- Hmm.

176
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:34,043
And whether you fight with us or not,

177
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:37,176
even you will transcend.

178
00:11:37,201 --> 00:11:39,215
Every member of the human family will.

179
00:11:39,493 --> 00:11:41,247
Good luck with that.

180
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:44,754
Do we have a deal or not?

181
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:46,454
You fool.

182
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,601
If we lose, it won't
matter what planet you're on

183
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,350
or whether you're fighting.

184
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:54,558
Every member of the human family dies.

185
00:11:58,504 --> 00:12:00,537
Clarke's child.

186
00:12:04,036 --> 00:12:05,036
Madi.

187
00:12:05,061 --> 00:12:07,009
Of course. Bellamy knew.

188
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:08,425
That's why she killed him.

189
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,816
Thank you.

190
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:16,609
She'll never let you take her child.

191
00:12:16,744 --> 00:12:18,244
I won't be asking.

192
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:21,393
Of course not. You'll send
a strike team no doubt,

193
00:12:21,418 --> 00:12:23,126
they'll fight you, the child, as well.

194
00:12:23,151 --> 00:12:25,652
If she gets killed, you'll have nothing.

195
00:12:29,134 --> 00:12:32,286
- You have a better idea?
- Yes.

196
00:12:32,326 --> 00:12:33,692
Send me.

197
00:12:40,646 --> 00:12:42,178
- You?
- Mmm.

198
00:12:42,203 --> 00:12:43,636
Who wants no part of this.

199
00:12:43,771 --> 00:12:46,435
That was before I
knew what was at stake.

200
00:12:47,093 --> 00:12:50,876
Although transcend or
die has a nice ring to it,

201
00:12:51,264 --> 00:12:55,266
it really isn't much of a choice, is it?

202
00:12:56,495 --> 00:12:59,177
I've been in the child's head.

203
00:13:00,115 --> 00:13:03,216
I know her better
that she knows herself.

204
00:13:05,002 --> 00:13:07,436
How well does your strike team know her?

205
00:13:07,739 --> 00:13:11,265
I'll get her back, but
then our deal still stands.

206
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,162
Take him to the bridge.

207
00:13:32,825 --> 00:13:35,025
I don't want to take inventory.

208
00:13:36,439 --> 00:13:38,606
So don't.

209
00:13:38,631 --> 00:13:40,130
We took everything we could carry

210
00:13:40,155 --> 00:13:41,921
when we marched for the valley.

211
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:48,050
Do your remember our first
night in our desert tent?

212
00:13:51,877 --> 00:13:53,343
Hey. You OK?

213
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,173
I told Bellamy I'd forgive him.

214
00:13:57,349 --> 00:13:58,982
Now I can't.

215
00:14:05,384 --> 00:14:07,084
Talk to me.

216
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:12,173
He forgave me for everything I did here.

217
00:14:13,801 --> 00:14:16,266
I wonder if my father would do that.

218
00:14:17,932 --> 00:14:20,088
I don't think he would.

219
00:14:21,477 --> 00:14:24,056
Your father wanted you to live, Nate.

220
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:27,691
That's why he gave up
his spot in this bunker,

221
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:30,651
and you have.

222
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:32,892
You are.

223
00:14:36,178 --> 00:14:37,987
Clarke's right.

224
00:14:38,772 --> 00:14:42,808
Everyone we care about
that's left is here.

225
00:14:45,238 --> 00:14:48,205
We thought Sanctum was
our second chance...

226
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,355
but I think this is.

227
00:14:57,623 --> 00:14:59,723
Welcome to Niylah's rec room.

228
00:14:59,764 --> 00:15:02,983
No cursing, no spitting, no killing.

229
00:15:05,128 --> 00:15:08,996
Huh. No way. A piano.

230
00:15:09,131 --> 00:15:11,013
I used to tickle the ivories.

231
00:15:11,038 --> 00:15:12,029
Jordan, hold this.

232
00:15:12,054 --> 00:15:14,044
It's been over 200 years, but, uh...

233
00:15:15,244 --> 00:15:16,944
Out of tune.

234
00:15:17,463 --> 00:15:19,529
What are you doing?

235
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:23,533
Ohh. There were too many
rules when we lived here.

236
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:26,847
I found my way around most of them.

237
00:15:32,788 --> 00:15:36,000
- The bar's open.
- Ahh. Is it safe?

238
00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:37,825
It was never safe.

239
00:15:43,105 --> 00:15:45,347
God, that's awful.

240
00:15:45,788 --> 00:15:48,089
It was your dad's recipe.

241
00:16:02,082 --> 00:16:03,649
Smooth.

242
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:08,767
Echo.

243
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:22,716
I'm tired.

244
00:16:24,355 --> 00:16:26,990
- I'll go with you.
- No.

245
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:28,833
I'm gonna.

246
00:16:28,858 --> 00:16:30,022
She needs space.

247
00:16:30,047 --> 00:16:32,747
And we need to drink.

248
00:16:34,549 --> 00:16:37,657
Oh. No, no, thank you.

249
00:16:38,076 --> 00:16:40,189
I'm tired, too.

250
00:16:40,515 --> 00:16:42,415
My dad made it.

251
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:50,587
OK. Hmm.

252
00:16:51,957 --> 00:16:53,557
- Oh, my...
- Ha ha ha!

253
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:58,662
- It's good, right?
- No. That's awful. Mmm.

254
00:16:58,797 --> 00:17:00,831
Oh, man.

255
00:17:03,626 --> 00:17:06,728
This'll do until we can
rebuild above ground.

256
00:17:08,591 --> 00:17:13,160
Pick a bed. You'll be less
mad at me in the morning.

257
00:17:16,332 --> 00:17:18,299
All these beds should
be filled with people.

258
00:17:18,324 --> 00:17:22,385
Oh, Madi, I'm really
not in the mood to argue.

259
00:17:30,001 --> 00:17:31,826
You decided for me...

260
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:33,969
again.

261
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:38,572
I decided for everyone.

262
00:17:39,067 --> 00:17:40,953
That's what I do.

263
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:45,667
Just like you decided to kill Bellamy.

264
00:17:47,913 --> 00:17:49,746
I did that to save you.

265
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:51,715
I didn't ask you to,

266
00:17:52,317 --> 00:17:54,011
and now you have to live with that!

267
00:17:54,235 --> 00:17:56,134
I don't want that for you!

268
00:17:57,475 --> 00:18:00,142
I know you're mad that
I stranded us here,

269
00:18:00,785 --> 00:18:03,593
but remember Shallow Valley,

270
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,893
when it was just us and all we
wanted was for our friends...

271
00:18:06,927 --> 00:18:10,454
Your friends. What about mine?

272
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:12,123
I was starting to build my own life.

273
00:18:12,148 --> 00:18:14,232
I have friends in Sanctum.

274
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:16,818
Picasso is there, Luca.

275
00:18:16,843 --> 00:18:18,865
You think you're protecting me,

276
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,247
but you're not.

277
00:18:21,336 --> 00:18:23,403
You ruined my life.

278
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:26,602
Just like you ruined your own.

279
00:18:28,923 --> 00:18:30,998
Madi, wait.

280
00:18:31,288 --> 00:18:34,201
This place is huge. You can't
just wander off in the dark.

281
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:40,864
I won't. Don't follow me.

282
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,712
Oh, let there be light.

283
00:18:53,731 --> 00:18:56,032
That's my girl.

284
00:19:00,596 --> 00:19:02,239
Well, thanks for your help.

285
00:19:02,264 --> 00:19:03,820
Now we find the stone,

286
00:19:03,845 --> 00:19:05,044
assuming you can fix this.

287
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:06,566
You're kidding, right?

288
00:19:06,591 --> 00:19:07,958
I'm not a miracle worker, Murphy.

289
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:09,392
I beg to differ.

290
00:19:09,417 --> 00:19:11,814
Come one. You know we can't
leave all those people on Sanctum

291
00:19:11,838 --> 00:19:14,101
now that we know it's survivable here.

292
00:19:14,632 --> 00:19:16,559
The people on Sanctum
are better off without us.

293
00:19:16,584 --> 00:19:18,656
Until the next eclipse maybe.

294
00:19:18,681 --> 00:19:19,949
Clarke is wrong.

295
00:19:19,974 --> 00:19:21,987
Some of those people
are from here, Raven,

296
00:19:22,012 --> 00:19:23,660
Wonkru, Eligius prisoners.

297
00:19:23,685 --> 00:19:25,585
Earth is their home, too.

298
00:19:26,051 --> 00:19:27,646
Let me ask you something.

299
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,160
When you let hatch and his buddies die,

300
00:19:30,185 --> 00:19:32,219
was that just to save your friends?

301
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,032
We passed a workshop down here.

302
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:42,833
6 years of watching Bellamy
manipulate her on the ring.

303
00:19:46,923 --> 00:19:48,525
Damn it.

304
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,921
I know.

305
00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:56,604
I miss him, too.

306
00:19:57,547 --> 00:19:59,128
Yeah.

307
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,848
_

308
00:20:04,698 --> 00:20:06,586
_

309
00:20:08,824 --> 00:20:11,261
_

310
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,649
_

311
00:20:15,911 --> 00:20:18,673
_

312
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,799
Did Lincoln teach you that?

313
00:20:28,753 --> 00:20:30,546
You weren't my only teacher.

314
00:20:31,372 --> 00:20:35,078
No. Just the best.

315
00:20:38,209 --> 00:20:41,110
It's your watch in the rotunda.

316
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:46,656
No way. I'm not going back down there.

317
00:20:47,044 --> 00:20:48,614
Fine.

318
00:20:49,877 --> 00:20:51,928
Then neither am I.

319
00:20:54,238 --> 00:20:56,040
I told you once

320
00:20:56,217 --> 00:20:58,651
we mourn the dead when the war is over.

321
00:20:59,304 --> 00:21:00,845
So is it over?

322
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:04,362
I hope so.

323
00:21:06,948 --> 00:21:09,312
I saw you days ago, but for you,

324
00:21:09,337 --> 00:21:11,851
it's been 10 years on another planet,

325
00:21:11,876 --> 00:21:13,827
yet still you haven't made peace

326
00:21:13,852 --> 00:21:15,495
with what happened here.

327
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,096
I thought I did.

328
00:21:18,535 --> 00:21:20,967
And then seeing the fighting pit again,

329
00:21:21,148 --> 00:21:22,748
I don't know.

330
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:27,030
We did what we had to do to survive,

331
00:21:27,616 --> 00:21:31,997
but if it is your penance to sit here

332
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,234
in the freezing cold,

333
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:35,949
then it is my penance, too,

334
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:38,436
because I am equally guilty

335
00:21:38,532 --> 00:21:40,732
about what happened down there.

336
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,953
We were all Blodreina.

337
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:58,545
Now come on. We'll face
your demons together.

338
00:22:05,277 --> 00:22:06,810
You win.

339
00:22:32,524 --> 00:22:35,365
Conclave rules. Conclave rules.

340
00:22:36,691 --> 00:22:39,792
Win the fight, save your life.

341
00:22:57,378 --> 00:22:59,498
I used to resent when you
would look at her like that.

342
00:22:59,547 --> 00:23:02,348
- Gaia.
- I don't anymore.

343
00:23:03,861 --> 00:23:06,410
I am glad Octavia came to you.

344
00:23:06,435 --> 00:23:08,802
She was always more warrior than I.

345
00:23:09,057 --> 00:23:11,632
I am sorry that I wasn't.

346
00:23:12,594 --> 00:23:15,220
I'm the one who's sorry.

347
00:23:15,997 --> 00:23:18,931
My child, don't you know?

348
00:23:20,602 --> 00:23:22,702
You're my Seda.

349
00:23:26,774 --> 00:23:28,507
Here they come!

350
00:23:29,652 --> 00:23:30,918
On me!

351
00:23:31,212 --> 00:23:32,845
Gaia!

352
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,772
What was that? Why open
the bridge and not use it?

353
00:23:49,923 --> 00:23:54,025
They used it. Someone's here.

354
00:23:55,076 --> 00:23:56,813
I can feel it.

355
00:23:56,838 --> 00:23:58,443
They're here for Madi.

356
00:23:58,468 --> 00:23:59,531
Go warn Clarke.

357
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:01,601
I'll stay and make sure
no one else comes through.

358
00:24:01,626 --> 00:24:03,660
I'm not leaving you again.

359
00:24:04,056 --> 00:24:05,822
I'll go.

360
00:24:43,051 --> 00:24:44,884
They're here for Madi.

361
00:24:44,962 --> 00:24:46,787
Where is she?

362
00:24:47,331 --> 00:24:49,031
We had a fight.

363
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:53,459
I have to find her.

364
00:24:57,694 --> 00:24:58,694
Madi!

365
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:11,043
Hey. I like that song.

366
00:25:16,531 --> 00:25:18,356
What? No.

367
00:25:23,323 --> 00:25:24,956
Um...

368
00:25:28,149 --> 00:25:30,182
I'm... I'm sorry. I...

369
00:25:35,403 --> 00:25:38,571
This is the part where you
go after her, mi hermano.

370
00:25:42,482 --> 00:25:44,394
Hi, Madi.

371
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,943
Madi's here?

372
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,524
Ohh.

373
00:25:51,256 --> 00:25:53,089
There she is.

374
00:25:57,054 --> 00:25:59,354
It's OK, Niylah. You
can drink in front of me.

375
00:25:59,379 --> 00:26:01,546
Uh, she's had enough anyway.

376
00:26:01,896 --> 00:26:05,028
What? I'm fine.

377
00:26:05,053 --> 00:26:06,486
Madi?

378
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:08,968
If you can hear me...

379
00:26:09,245 --> 00:26:11,512
She wasn't on level 6 either.

380
00:26:14,108 --> 00:26:17,109
There's 4 more levels. We'll find her.

381
00:26:18,164 --> 00:26:19,559
OK.

382
00:26:29,991 --> 00:26:31,624
The party's over.

383
00:26:33,494 --> 00:26:34,994
Grownups.

384
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:42,572
Will you play something else?

385
00:26:42,953 --> 00:26:46,806
Ahh. I'll do better than that.

386
00:26:46,831 --> 00:26:49,999
Have a seat. I'll teach you.

387
00:26:50,024 --> 00:26:52,625
- Really?
- Yeah. It's easy.

388
00:26:52,693 --> 00:26:56,829
It's only taken me 200
years to figure out.

389
00:26:56,854 --> 00:26:58,354
Madi?

390
00:27:00,403 --> 00:27:01,868
Answer me!

391
00:27:01,893 --> 00:27:04,627
Hands like this. OK.

392
00:27:08,118 --> 00:27:09,751
We're gonna play a C.

393
00:27:12,383 --> 00:27:13,749
Madi!

394
00:27:28,154 --> 00:27:29,620
You're drunk.

395
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,777
And you said you were tired,

396
00:27:32,802 --> 00:27:35,095
but you're still up, so...

397
00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:42,714
Why are you still up, Echo?

398
00:27:43,002 --> 00:27:44,435
Not Echo.

399
00:27:46,577 --> 00:27:47,976
Ash.

400
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,620
My name is Ash.

401
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:55,690
Don't worry. I never
told Bellamy either.

402
00:27:56,864 --> 00:27:58,297
6 years,

403
00:27:58,495 --> 00:28:01,131
and I never told him my real name.

404
00:28:01,676 --> 00:28:04,777
Every day, I'd wake
up and think to myself

405
00:28:05,047 --> 00:28:06,880
"today's the day."

406
00:28:08,828 --> 00:28:10,265
But no.

407
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,283
When I finally told someone,

408
00:28:13,626 --> 00:28:15,560
it was to save my life.

409
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:20,653
Echo was a coward.

410
00:28:21,874 --> 00:28:23,207
No.

411
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:30,208
Not a coward. Human.

412
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:35,625
I wanted him to see me as
this person I've become,

413
00:28:35,894 --> 00:28:40,107
not pity me for who I was
or what I went through or...

414
00:28:40,187 --> 00:28:43,082
He did. He wouldn't have
stayed with you that long

415
00:28:43,107 --> 00:28:45,527
if he couldn't see the real you, Echo.

416
00:28:56,719 --> 00:28:58,464
I mean Ash.

417
00:29:00,721 --> 00:29:03,364
You're not the only one with secrets.

418
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:06,745
I was named for Queen Nia.

419
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:10,998
What? But you're Trikru.

420
00:29:11,102 --> 00:29:13,221
My father's side.

421
00:29:14,538 --> 00:29:16,471
My mother was Azgeda.

422
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:19,175
That's why we lived so
far out in the woods.

423
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,964
So no one would see her scars.

424
00:29:28,879 --> 00:29:31,124
We are who we choose to be,

425
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,912
and we don't owe anyone our pain.

426
00:29:42,383 --> 00:29:44,683
What is taking you so long?

427
00:29:48,194 --> 00:29:50,494
Miracles take time.

428
00:29:50,972 --> 00:29:53,940
Hero Murphy's kind of freaking me out.

429
00:29:53,965 --> 00:29:55,583
I know...

430
00:29:56,804 --> 00:29:58,471
But it's hot.

431
00:29:58,948 --> 00:30:01,058
I'm right here, and also I'm not a hero.

432
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:03,607
I just think the people on
Sanctum deserve to live on a planet

433
00:30:03,632 --> 00:30:07,044
that doesn't eat them or
occasionally drive them insane.

434
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:27,508
Hey.

435
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:31,289
We haven't, uh, properly met. I am...

436
00:30:31,314 --> 00:30:32,871
John Murphy.

437
00:30:33,349 --> 00:30:35,349
I've heard stories.

438
00:30:35,374 --> 00:30:36,907
I tend to play well in stories.

439
00:30:36,932 --> 00:30:39,970
Hmm. Not these.

440
00:30:40,569 --> 00:30:43,637
Those stories. Yes.

441
00:30:45,706 --> 00:30:47,706
You OK?

442
00:30:48,955 --> 00:30:51,255
Hey, Murphy.

443
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:54,158
I... got this.

444
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:59,763
OK. I was his favorite, though,

445
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:01,918
wasn't I, Jordan?

446
00:31:06,327 --> 00:31:08,810
I am sorry I upset you.

447
00:31:08,945 --> 00:31:11,675
I haven't spent a lot of
time with people, and...

448
00:31:12,714 --> 00:31:15,226
sometimes I just misread things.

449
00:31:15,449 --> 00:31:17,616
Yeah. Me, too.

450
00:31:31,864 --> 00:31:33,240
I was having fun dancing,

451
00:31:33,265 --> 00:31:35,574
- and I thought you...
- I was.

452
00:31:36,513 --> 00:31:38,884
I just started to feel guilty.

453
00:31:39,727 --> 00:31:41,226
I know.

454
00:31:43,452 --> 00:31:45,446
I felt the same when I woke from cryo

455
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:47,438
and my parents were gone.

456
00:31:48,947 --> 00:31:51,581
It takes time, but it does get easier.

457
00:31:59,703 --> 00:32:00,892
We should get back.

458
00:32:00,917 --> 00:32:02,257
You don't have to dance if you...

459
00:32:02,282 --> 00:32:04,201
You know, let's dance here.

460
00:32:04,801 --> 00:32:06,801
- There's no music.
- Mmm.

461
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,519
OK.

462
00:32:21,547 --> 00:32:23,080
OK.

463
00:32:31,513 --> 00:32:34,981
Madi, where are you?

464
00:32:35,006 --> 00:32:37,272
Madi! Madi!

465
00:32:37,297 --> 00:32:38,697
- Clarke?
- Hey, hey. What?

466
00:32:38,721 --> 00:32:39,987
Whoa, whoa. What happened?

467
00:32:40,012 --> 00:32:41,879
Is Madi with you?

468
00:32:42,344 --> 00:32:44,812
Did you fix it? I
need to find the stone.

469
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:48,005
Oh, now you want to find the stone?

470
00:32:48,251 --> 00:32:50,728
I'm sorry, Murphy. You were right.

471
00:32:50,753 --> 00:32:51,952
We need to leave.

472
00:32:51,977 --> 00:32:53,864
Why? What happened?

473
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:55,452
Disciples are after Madi.

474
00:32:55,477 --> 00:32:56,924
Has anyone seen her?

475
00:32:56,949 --> 00:32:58,916
She's in the rec room.

476
00:32:59,051 --> 00:33:01,452
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

477
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:08,002
No, no, no. No, no!

478
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,560
Madi!

479
00:33:10,596 --> 00:33:11,762
Madi!

480
00:33:11,787 --> 00:33:16,156
E, E, F, G.

481
00:33:16,181 --> 00:33:18,181
Yeah. It's that easy.

482
00:33:18,481 --> 00:33:21,149
It's only 5 notes, but...

483
00:33:21,556 --> 00:33:24,562
yeah, it almost feels... Familiar.

484
00:33:24,587 --> 00:33:28,422
Hmm. That is the
beauty of Mr. Beethoven.

485
00:33:28,637 --> 00:33:32,172
OK. Try again, but this time, I want...

486
00:33:56,733 --> 00:33:58,451
Help! Get away from me!

487
00:34:08,496 --> 00:34:10,734
Hello, Madi.

488
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:15,782
It seems you're the key to the
transcendence of the human race.

489
00:34:16,761 --> 00:34:19,428
They sent me to bring you back,

490
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,750
but, you see,

491
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,108
I don't want to transcend.

492
00:34:25,903 --> 00:34:27,966
I want to reign.

493
00:34:28,606 --> 00:34:30,606
They gave me a choice...

494
00:34:30,742 --> 00:34:35,344
Use these to bring you back peacefully

495
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,029
or this...

496
00:34:38,393 --> 00:34:40,744
if you wouldn't go willingly.

497
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:46,027
I prefer option 3...

498
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:50,972
to gut you like a pig.

499
00:34:54,544 --> 00:34:55,910
Go!

500
00:34:57,403 --> 00:34:59,970
Indra's in the rotunda. Get help!

501
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,607
Help! Clarke!

502
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:12,374
Help!

503
00:35:12,717 --> 00:35:15,251
Gaia, Indra!

504
00:35:15,378 --> 00:35:16,677
Do you hear that?

505
00:35:16,702 --> 00:35:18,969
- Help!
- It sounds like Madi.

506
00:35:20,992 --> 00:35:24,583
- We let them in. On me.
- Gabriel needs help!

507
00:35:26,197 --> 00:35:27,530
- Madi?
- He's here!

508
00:35:27,665 --> 00:35:30,666
- Madi, what is it?
- Help! No!

509
00:35:32,925 --> 00:35:33,925
You.

510
00:35:34,072 --> 00:35:35,705
Me.

511
00:35:38,721 --> 00:35:39,721
Us.

512
00:35:39,746 --> 00:35:41,512
Madi, clear out.

513
00:36:08,886 --> 00:36:10,735
_

514
00:36:14,997 --> 00:36:16,779
Not today.

515
00:36:34,389 --> 00:36:35,430
Murphy, give it up.

516
00:36:35,454 --> 00:36:36,756
It's never gonna break.

517
00:36:39,855 --> 00:36:41,500
You were saying?

518
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:42,721
Nice job, Murphy.

519
00:36:42,746 --> 00:36:44,541
All in a day's work, my friends.

520
00:36:44,566 --> 00:36:46,867
Thanks, Murphy. All right. Let's go.

521
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,653
Gabriel.

522
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:02,045
Gabriel. No, no, no, no.

523
00:37:04,786 --> 00:37:06,954
Hope... my friend.

524
00:37:06,979 --> 00:37:09,789
I'm right here. I'm with you.

525
00:37:10,217 --> 00:37:11,630
Where is she?

526
00:37:12,437 --> 00:37:13,637
Madi.

527
00:37:16,297 --> 00:37:17,531
Sheidheda.

528
00:37:19,689 --> 00:37:21,292
I tried.

529
00:37:22,276 --> 00:37:24,038
I'm right here.

530
00:37:24,797 --> 00:37:27,899
Thank God. Are you hurt?

531
00:37:30,488 --> 00:37:32,255
He saved my life.

532
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,323
Sheidheda got away.

533
00:37:36,718 --> 00:37:39,875
He stabbed himself in the gut and...

534
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,384
disappeared.

535
00:37:42,304 --> 00:37:44,268
I know how that works.

536
00:37:44,618 --> 00:37:46,584
Cadogan will send more disciples.

537
00:37:46,733 --> 00:37:49,129
We have to get back to Sanctum now.

538
00:37:49,374 --> 00:37:51,193
The stone.

539
00:37:51,808 --> 00:37:52,941
Find the stone.

540
00:37:52,966 --> 00:37:54,381
I couldn't fix the helmet.

541
00:37:54,503 --> 00:37:56,903
Sheidheda's. He left it.

542
00:38:03,311 --> 00:38:04,399
It's damaged.

543
00:38:04,424 --> 00:38:06,990
It can't pinpoint the exact location.

544
00:38:09,343 --> 00:38:10,809
The stone's here.

545
00:38:12,705 --> 00:38:14,305
What'd we miss?

546
00:38:17,558 --> 00:38:19,781
- Tell me what happened.
- I don't know.

547
00:38:20,582 --> 00:38:23,307
No. No, no, no, no.

548
00:38:23,674 --> 00:38:25,507
I'm ready.

549
00:38:26,745 --> 00:38:29,112
What do you mean the
stone's here? Where?

550
00:38:29,468 --> 00:38:30,647
I don't know.

551
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:32,150
We find it,

552
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,443
we go back to Sanctum, we get our army.

553
00:38:34,468 --> 00:38:37,744
Clarke, you're not going to war over me.

554
00:38:38,206 --> 00:38:40,968
If they try to take you, I am.

555
00:38:40,993 --> 00:38:42,626
All of us are.

556
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:49,064
No one else is getting
killed trying to protect me.

557
00:38:55,462 --> 00:38:56,750
Madi!

558
00:38:57,631 --> 00:39:00,184
- Maybe I should just...
- Absolutely not.

559
00:39:01,943 --> 00:39:03,446
Do something!

560
00:39:03,578 --> 00:39:07,046
Hope, I want this. It's OK.

561
00:39:08,866 --> 00:39:11,040
In peace, may you leave this shore.

562
00:39:11,065 --> 00:39:12,684
In love...

563
00:39:13,148 --> 00:39:14,314
No.

564
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,514
May you find the next.

565
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,420
Safe passage on your travels

566
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,467
until our final journey on the ground.

567
00:39:23,897 --> 00:39:25,738
_

568
00:39:25,804 --> 00:39:26,870
May we meet again.

569
00:39:26,895 --> 00:39:28,828
May we meet again.

570
00:39:36,538 --> 00:39:38,004
God!

571
00:39:45,499 --> 00:39:46,873
Madi?

572
00:39:47,946 --> 00:39:49,779
Madi?!

573
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,553
The vent.

574
00:39:52,578 --> 00:39:53,910
What?

575
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,495
Raven, Murphy, find that stone!

576
00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:05,296
Madi, put the knife down.

577
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:07,087
Don't take another step.

578
00:40:08,241 --> 00:40:09,757
I am sorry.

579
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,312
I did not know what she
wanted until it was too late.

580
00:40:12,337 --> 00:40:14,996
Octavia said Cadogan would
just keep sending more people

581
00:40:15,021 --> 00:40:16,119
until he gets me.

582
00:40:16,144 --> 00:40:18,078
No one will ever be safe.

583
00:40:18,284 --> 00:40:20,451
Madi, please don't do this.

584
00:40:20,727 --> 00:40:23,735
I told you no one else
is dying to save me.

585
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,262
Madi... please.

586
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,619
I love you, Clarke.

587
00:40:29,809 --> 00:40:31,343
No!

588
00:40:40,224 --> 00:40:41,573
_

589
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:45,138
Be prepared!

590
00:40:45,432 --> 00:40:46,965
They'll be invisible.

591
00:40:52,647 --> 00:40:54,105
Bomb!

592
00:41:22,527 --> 00:41:24,294
What the hell was that?

593
00:41:35,646 --> 00:41:37,278
Emori, it was nothing. Come back.

594
00:41:37,303 --> 00:41:39,236
Quiet. Listen.

595
00:41:50,147 --> 00:41:55,147
