1
00:00:37,615 --> 00:00:38,881
Almost there!

2
00:00:39,017 --> 00:00:41,050
Stay with us,
Emori. Stay with us!

3
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:44,097
Ok. Slow, slow. Murph.

4
00:00:44,122 --> 00:00:45,721
I got it!

5
00:00:45,857 --> 00:00:47,623
Raven, get the defibrillator.

6
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:49,162
- Where?
- There!

7
00:00:49,187 --> 00:00:50,417
Hey. Come on,
baby. Come on, baby.

8
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:51,996
Stay with me.

9
00:00:53,498 --> 00:00:55,231
- Good. Now...
- I know how.

10
00:00:55,262 --> 00:00:56,528
I've used one on myself.

11
00:00:56,768 --> 00:00:58,701
Jax, what can I do?

12
00:00:58,836 --> 00:01:00,336
Nothing yet.

13
00:01:02,592 --> 00:01:03,725
- OK.
- Set.

14
00:01:03,908 --> 00:01:04,974
Clear!

15
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:12,081
Come on!

16
00:01:12,106 --> 00:01:13,583
One more time. Come on.

17
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:14,931
Raven, clear!

18
00:01:26,531 --> 00:01:28,242
- Good job.
- Her pulse is weak.

19
00:01:28,266 --> 00:01:29,732
She's lost too much blood.

20
00:01:29,868 --> 00:01:32,969
- So we give her mine.
- Mine, too.

21
00:01:33,104 --> 00:01:34,582
Murphy's a
Nightblood. You're not.

22
00:01:34,606 --> 00:01:36,739
- Wha...
- Just go back for the others.

23
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,485
I can't just leave her like this.

24
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,649
Unless you've done abdominal
surgery on yourself, too,

25
00:01:40,674 --> 00:01:42,475
there's nothing more you can do.

26
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,071
I'll get her stable,
then take out the bar.

27
00:01:44,095 --> 00:01:45,951
Raven, he's right.
They could be trapped.

28
00:01:45,976 --> 00:01:46,975
You got to get them out.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,308
- Alone? How? I...
- I don't know.

30
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:50,594
Never mind. I'll figure it out.

31
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:51,967
Just...

32
00:01:52,657 --> 00:01:54,451
just save her.

33
00:01:55,026 --> 00:01:56,562
Hey.

34
00:01:57,607 --> 00:01:58,837
Once our friends are safe,

35
00:01:58,862 --> 00:02:00,913
you have to go after Madi, OK?

36
00:02:00,938 --> 00:02:02,803
You have to stop Cadogan.

37
00:02:16,514 --> 00:02:17,740
Shepherd en route to bridge.

38
00:02:17,764 --> 00:02:19,264
All disciples, stay alert.

39
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,252
The Shepherd's
unit will be with him

40
00:02:24,276 --> 00:02:25,809
guarding the door.

41
00:02:26,102 --> 00:02:27,735
Too bad for them.

42
00:02:30,862 --> 00:02:32,665
Grenades?

43
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,150
So more killing, that's the answer?

44
00:02:36,466 --> 00:02:38,466
It's what we do.

45
00:02:38,903 --> 00:02:41,101
Maybe we don't deserve to transcend.

46
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,972
Cover me.

47
00:03:11,675 --> 00:03:13,441
We're too late.

48
00:03:36,272 --> 00:03:38,405
What took you so long?

49
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,484
Our pier.

50
00:03:44,736 --> 00:03:47,136
I took you fishing here once.

51
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,006
Why only once?

52
00:03:49,174 --> 00:03:50,639
You jumped in.

53
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,999
Oh, I told you not to,

54
00:03:54,245 --> 00:03:55,978
but you didn't listen.

55
00:03:56,813 --> 00:03:58,570
You never listened.

56
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:02,785
She took after her mother.

57
00:04:06,024 --> 00:04:07,356
You're not Callie.

58
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,321
No. This is who you chose.

59
00:04:10,528 --> 00:04:14,202
We most often take the form of
the subject's greatest teacher

60
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:17,567
or the source of their greatest failure.

61
00:04:17,702 --> 00:04:21,345
In the rare emotion-driven
species such as your own,

62
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:23,706
it can be their greatest love.

63
00:04:23,842 --> 00:04:26,110
Seems you're faced
with all of the above.

64
00:04:27,591 --> 00:04:28,857
Are you God?

65
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:33,952
For our purposes, you may
consider me your judge.

66
00:04:35,487 --> 00:04:37,320
My judge? So they were right.

67
00:04:37,455 --> 00:04:41,746
This is a trial, a test, not a war.

68
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:43,551
Correct.

69
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:46,643
The last of your kind to
stand before us... Becca...

70
00:04:46,755 --> 00:04:48,788
refused the test.

71
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,313
Tell me... Dad,

72
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:54,114
is the human race now ready to join us?

73
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:56,706
Yes... we are ready.

74
00:04:56,785 --> 00:04:58,385
Excellent.

75
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,739
Here's how it works. We talk,

76
00:05:00,922 --> 00:05:03,453
I ask questions, you answer truthfully.

77
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:05,834
If you do not, I will know it.

78
00:05:06,128 --> 00:05:08,245
If your answers are satisfactory,

79
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,662
your consciousness and that

80
00:05:09,687 --> 00:05:12,594
of your entire species
will become one with ours.

81
00:05:12,619 --> 00:05:15,237
You will transcend your human
form and become infinite.

82
00:05:15,262 --> 00:05:17,760
If you fail to earn
this evolutionary leap,

83
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:19,706
you will be eliminated,

84
00:05:19,731 --> 00:05:21,563
turned to crystal the way the Bardoans

85
00:05:21,596 --> 00:05:24,433
and countless other
civilizations before them were.

86
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:26,202
Sound good?

87
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,406
The first question is about love.

88
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:33,229
So few species are given this gift,

89
00:05:33,524 --> 00:05:36,754
yet you have attempted to erase
it in pursuit of this moment.

90
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:38,611
Why?

91
00:05:57,168 --> 00:05:58,768
Pencils down.

92
00:06:05,063 --> 00:06:06,045
My turn.

93
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,104
Get some water.

94
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:10,373
Sounds like they're getting closer.

95
00:06:17,249 --> 00:06:20,450
Gaia took the last of
the water on her hunt.

96
00:06:22,726 --> 00:06:24,559
I'll go to the river.

97
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,946
I hate waiting.

98
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,214
Done too much of it.

99
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,139
Trust me, I know.

100
00:06:50,905 --> 00:06:53,611
But Octavia and Clarke can
take care of themselves.

101
00:06:54,241 --> 00:06:55,906
Thank you.

102
00:06:56,971 --> 00:06:59,310
That's what friends are for.

103
00:06:59,763 --> 00:07:01,429
Friends, huh?

104
00:07:12,642 --> 00:07:15,877
Can... friends do this?

105
00:07:27,022 --> 00:07:29,005
Oh, they're back!

106
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,261
Form up! Attack on my orders!

107
00:07:42,883 --> 00:07:44,516
What the hell are you doing here?

108
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:47,509
Saving our asses again.

109
00:07:50,123 --> 00:07:51,656
Thank you.

110
00:07:51,792 --> 00:07:53,892
It's what Hatch would do.

111
00:07:54,084 --> 00:07:55,884
- Stone's right through there.
- Copy that.

112
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:56,985
The rest of you beat it

113
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,865
unless you want a lung
full of pulverized bunker.

114
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:02,153
Hey! We've
got people down there.

115
00:08:03,312 --> 00:08:06,367
So you do. Hear that, boys?

116
00:08:06,392 --> 00:08:08,173
- Yep.
- Set phasers to stun.

117
00:08:08,198 --> 00:08:09,423
You got it.

118
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:11,710
It's not Jackson. He's fine.

119
00:08:11,735 --> 00:08:13,001
In Sanctum treating Emori.

120
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,335
Murphy's with them.

121
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,985
It's got to be
Echo or Niylah then.

122
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,073
Why not the others?

123
00:08:17,098 --> 00:08:18,364
There are no others.

124
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:21,389
Gabriel's dead. Cadogan
has Madi on Bardo.

125
00:08:21,414 --> 00:08:23,405
Clarke and Octavia went to get her back.

126
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,590
They're to return for us
so we can help stop him.

127
00:08:25,615 --> 00:08:27,181
Fire in the hole!

128
00:08:29,052 --> 00:08:30,353
Then let's do that.

129
00:08:30,378 --> 00:08:32,728
How? Cadogan will be
mobilizing his army for war.

130
00:08:32,753 --> 00:08:33,673
We got 10 people.

131
00:08:33,698 --> 00:08:35,270
With Sheidheda
dead, Wonkru will fight.

132
00:08:35,294 --> 00:08:37,071
- We go to Sanctum first.
- Fire in the hole.

133
00:08:37,096 --> 00:08:38,962
Wonkru will lose, Indra.

134
00:08:39,217 --> 00:08:40,516
Miller's right.

135
00:08:40,764 --> 00:08:43,728
What we need is a
distraction, not a fight,

136
00:08:43,753 --> 00:08:47,035
a way to get a small team past
their army to kill Cadogan.

137
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,295
Energy weapons.

138
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,783
Their weapons require energy, too.

139
00:08:53,808 --> 00:08:57,221
Too bad we won't be able to
see what we're firing ours at.

140
00:08:58,381 --> 00:09:00,126
Maybe we will.

141
00:09:01,518 --> 00:09:03,182
Look what I found.

142
00:09:04,031 --> 00:09:05,597
Hope!

143
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,725
More importantly,
we're through the collapse.

144
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,325
Good. Then let's go.

145
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,564
Wait. What about Gaia?

146
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:15,984
I'm sorry. Clarke and Octavia
are in trouble on Bardo.

147
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:17,308
Sounds familiar.

148
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,318
Indra, we can't wait for her.

149
00:09:18,343 --> 00:09:19,930
Slow down. We
still don't have a plan

150
00:09:19,954 --> 00:09:21,628
that doesn't end with all of us dead.

151
00:09:21,653 --> 00:09:24,787
Actually, I think Jordan was
just about to tell us one.

152
00:09:27,325 --> 00:09:29,596
This one would make my father proud.

153
00:09:44,219 --> 00:09:46,062
For my first trick,

154
00:09:46,663 --> 00:09:49,014
I will make an army appear.

155
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,638
I'm offline. Weapons not responsive.

156
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,653
- I've got nothing.
- None of us do.

157
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,098
This is not the stone room.

158
00:10:03,123 --> 00:10:04,722
The distraction can still work.

159
00:10:04,785 --> 00:10:06,566
Insertion team, go now!

160
00:10:06,591 --> 00:10:08,257
Copy that. Echo, lead the way.

161
00:10:08,282 --> 00:10:10,948
The rest of you, into the trees!

162
00:10:13,303 --> 00:10:15,253
The last war is here!

163
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:16,642
Their weapons are down.

164
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:18,300
Why aren't they attacking?

165
00:10:18,728 --> 00:10:21,829
Move, move, move, move!

166
00:10:34,521 --> 00:10:36,854
Well, they're distracted.

167
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:38,030
Yeah. Long enough for us to die.

168
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,421
We all will die.

169
00:10:39,446 --> 00:10:41,163
When is out of our control.

170
00:10:41,188 --> 00:10:42,687
This is a good how.

171
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:49,668
She's as stable as she's
gonna get. It's time.

172
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:51,325
Jax.

173
00:10:55,185 --> 00:10:56,551
Thank God.

174
00:10:59,836 --> 00:11:01,073
Raven got you out?

175
00:11:01,098 --> 00:11:03,843
Yeah. She and Wonkru
just left for Bardo.

176
00:11:04,775 --> 00:11:06,374
Without you?

177
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,932
I'm not leaving you again.

178
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,746
Whatever happens next,
we stick together.

179
00:11:12,617 --> 00:11:14,917
I am glad you are safe.

180
00:11:15,118 --> 00:11:17,185
Now how about my reunion?

181
00:11:21,424 --> 00:11:22,745
What can I do?

182
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,703
Help hold her steady
while I take this out.

183
00:11:25,028 --> 00:11:26,394
If she moves,

184
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:27,917
it'll cause even more damage.

185
00:11:27,942 --> 00:11:29,875
- You understand?
- Yeah.

186
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,473
On 3.

187
00:11:33,737 --> 00:11:35,639
1...

188
00:11:35,832 --> 00:11:37,231
2...

189
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:39,373
3.

190
00:11:43,585 --> 00:11:44,759
Hey, hey!

191
00:11:44,784 --> 00:11:47,874
Hey. Come on. Emori, Emori! Emori!

192
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:48,998
She's bleeding out.

193
00:11:49,022 --> 00:11:50,694
I have to get in there
surgically and find the...

194
00:11:50,718 --> 00:11:52,045
Hurry up!

195
00:11:54,664 --> 00:11:56,331
No, Emori!

196
00:11:59,313 --> 00:12:00,813
Adrenaline.

197
00:12:11,608 --> 00:12:13,141
What are you doing?

198
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:16,654
Do something! Come on! Do something!

199
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:18,346
You're a doctor! Please!

200
00:12:20,283 --> 00:12:21,949
No.

201
00:12:25,054 --> 00:12:26,654
No, no, no, no.

202
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,112
Hey, hey.

203
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:32,273
Emori. No.

204
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:36,531
Emori, please. Emori, please.

205
00:13:04,835 --> 00:13:06,735
Take out her mind drive.

206
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,204
- Please.
- Please what?

207
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:11,183
Put her mind in your head?

208
00:13:11,413 --> 00:13:14,635
We know from Clarke and
Josephine how that ends.

209
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:16,305
Fine.

210
00:13:17,748 --> 00:13:19,614
- I'll do it myself.
- Mur...

211
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,590
If you died

212
00:13:28,693 --> 00:13:30,927
and I could see you again,

213
00:13:31,284 --> 00:13:33,217
I would do the same thing.

214
00:13:38,835 --> 00:13:40,702
I got this.

215
00:13:42,741 --> 00:13:45,502
You do realize that
if Clarke can't stop the test

216
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,526
then we are buying time for Wanheda

217
00:13:47,551 --> 00:13:50,217
to be the witness for the human race.

218
00:13:51,275 --> 00:13:53,470
Can I ask you something?

219
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:56,646
If she gets it done,

220
00:13:57,229 --> 00:13:59,263
will my brother transcend?

221
00:13:59,558 --> 00:14:04,137
No. Shepherd's passage, "Book of Bardo,"

222
00:14:04,162 --> 00:14:05,796
Chapter 1, Verse 6.

223
00:14:05,931 --> 00:14:07,793
"Death is the end, my friend.

224
00:14:07,818 --> 00:14:10,129
Only the living shall transcend."

225
00:14:10,754 --> 00:14:12,921
Must have slept through that class.

226
00:14:17,276 --> 00:14:19,787
- What?
- If she does take the test,

227
00:14:19,812 --> 00:14:21,399
then today's the end.

228
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:25,048
Either way, transcendence
or extinction...

229
00:14:28,137 --> 00:14:30,415
I would have liked to
live a little first.

230
00:14:30,892 --> 00:14:32,383
Same.

231
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,735
Sorry to interrupt.

232
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,326
Ohh!

233
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:43,567
- What happened here?
- We did.

234
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:45,187
Don't tell me
Cadogan killed Madi.

235
00:14:45,211 --> 00:14:46,622
Worse than killed her.

236
00:14:46,647 --> 00:14:48,395
Clarke went in after
him to stop the test.

237
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,461
- Went in?
- How do you know

238
00:14:49,485 --> 00:14:50,583
you weren't followed?

239
00:14:50,608 --> 00:14:52,080
Hey. You can relax.

240
00:14:52,105 --> 00:14:53,428
The disciples have their hands full

241
00:14:53,452 --> 00:14:54,596
with Wonkru right now.

242
00:14:54,621 --> 00:14:56,426
What, you brought an army here?

243
00:14:56,451 --> 00:14:58,250
They're not here to fight.

244
00:14:58,484 --> 00:15:00,194
It was a distraction to get us inside

245
00:15:00,219 --> 00:15:02,591
- so we can kill Cadogan.
- The disciples don't know that.

246
00:15:02,616 --> 00:15:04,655
If Clarke can't stop the test
to determine whether or not

247
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:06,067
the human race deserves to transcend

248
00:15:06,091 --> 00:15:08,069
while what's left of the
human race is fighting a war...

249
00:15:08,093 --> 00:15:10,194
- That would be bad.
- Worse than bad.

250
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:12,529
If we fail, the transcendents send Gem9.

251
00:15:12,775 --> 00:15:14,131
The spy understands.

252
00:15:14,156 --> 00:15:16,890
Look. I'm sorry for
what I did to you, OK?

253
00:15:17,141 --> 00:15:18,234
I wasn't myself.

254
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:19,425
We'll make friends later.

255
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:21,242
Right now, we have to stop the war.

256
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:22,699
Levitt, on me.

257
00:15:23,409 --> 00:15:24,449
I'm going with them.

258
00:15:24,577 --> 00:15:26,810
Raven, get that bridge open.

259
00:15:33,104 --> 00:15:35,204
You don't see that every day.

260
00:15:44,275 --> 00:15:46,775
Why am I still here?

261
00:15:46,966 --> 00:15:48,832
You know why.

262
00:15:55,835 --> 00:15:57,401
Lexa.

263
00:16:07,086 --> 00:16:09,378
I'm not her, Clarke.

264
00:16:10,222 --> 00:16:11,989
I know.

265
00:16:21,544 --> 00:16:23,044
The test isn't over?

266
00:16:23,235 --> 00:16:27,676
No. I'm sorry. We can't stop
what's been set in motion.

267
00:16:28,307 --> 00:16:31,975
Your species must now
be judged through you.

268
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,054
This man was unarmed, no threat to you,

269
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:42,714
yet you killed him.

270
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:45,832
Why?

271
00:16:48,598 --> 00:16:50,523
He killed my daughter.

272
00:16:52,618 --> 00:16:54,531
Is Madi dead?

273
00:16:55,412 --> 00:16:59,629
No, but she will be because of him.

274
00:17:00,502 --> 00:17:02,506
So your need for
revenge is more important

275
00:17:02,531 --> 00:17:04,318
than the fate of the entire human race?

276
00:17:04,343 --> 00:17:08,512
It's not revenge. It's justice.

277
00:17:08,647 --> 00:17:10,213
Clarke...

278
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:14,197
_

279
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:19,237
_

280
00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:22,672
You don't know my pain.

281
00:17:22,697 --> 00:17:24,094
You're wrong.

282
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,887
During the test, I
sense every part of you.

283
00:17:27,766 --> 00:17:29,700
I'm feeling your pain right now.

284
00:17:29,756 --> 00:17:30,928
Really?

285
00:17:32,304 --> 00:17:36,158
Then feel me holding Lexa as she dies.

286
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:41,095
Feel me seeing someone
else wear my mother's face.

287
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,895
Feel me murder my best friend

288
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,429
to save my child,

289
00:17:48,454 --> 00:17:51,121
only to have her die anyway.

290
00:17:52,257 --> 00:17:53,941
Feel that.

291
00:17:54,015 --> 00:17:55,481
You suffer

292
00:17:56,253 --> 00:17:58,282
and inflict suffering on others.

293
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,852
Pain begets pain. That's
not justice, Clarke.

294
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:07,204
You say you do these things
to protect your people,

295
00:18:07,229 --> 00:18:09,744
but you're all one... people.

296
00:18:10,732 --> 00:18:13,324
That much Cadogan had right.

297
00:18:14,356 --> 00:18:17,903
He created a world without love

298
00:18:18,017 --> 00:18:19,617
to get to you.

299
00:18:19,918 --> 00:18:23,120
He killed my child to get to you.

300
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:26,921
Have you ever considered
that you're the problem?

301
00:18:26,946 --> 00:18:29,834
How dare you judge me

302
00:18:30,624 --> 00:18:33,055
when you annihilate entire species

303
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,699
because they don't
live up to your ideals?

304
00:18:35,944 --> 00:18:39,279
Have I pulled the lever
to commit genocide?

305
00:18:39,304 --> 00:18:41,405
Yes, I have.

306
00:18:42,886 --> 00:18:45,686
And did love make me do this?

307
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,230
You're damn right it did!

308
00:18:50,627 --> 00:18:52,560
But what's your excuse?

309
00:18:52,694 --> 00:18:55,095
You play games with people

310
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,115
and call yourselves higher beings.

311
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:02,958
You are no better than
the murderers I've killed,

312
00:19:03,379 --> 00:19:06,614
and you are no better than me!

313
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,400
I am sorry for all you have lost.

314
00:19:10,488 --> 00:19:12,322
You've borne so much...

315
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:18,043
But if you are humanity,

316
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,890
then I'm afraid humanity is not worthy

317
00:19:20,915 --> 00:19:22,881
of taking the next step.

318
00:19:25,235 --> 00:19:27,068
It has been decided.

319
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,041
_

320
00:20:09,116 --> 00:20:11,283
I remember that.

321
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:15,167
The place we first met.

322
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:18,465
Love at first knife to throat.

323
00:20:21,737 --> 00:20:23,737
Oh, you are so beautiful.

324
00:20:23,983 --> 00:20:26,450
John, where are we?

325
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,743
Josephine called it the mindspace.

326
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:32,703
If it were up to me, I would
have chosen our cave, but...

327
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:37,853
I died.

328
00:20:38,991 --> 00:20:40,691
You did.

329
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:43,567
Not acceptable.

330
00:20:45,741 --> 00:20:47,207
Hmm.

331
00:20:50,176 --> 00:20:52,609
You put my mind drive in your head.

332
00:20:53,897 --> 00:20:58,516
Two minds, one body. You'll die, too.

333
00:20:59,063 --> 00:21:00,291
You have to take it out.

334
00:21:00,316 --> 00:21:02,497
Without you, I'd just
be surviving, Emori.

335
00:21:02,522 --> 00:21:04,388
- I wouldn't be living.
- No.

336
00:21:04,413 --> 00:21:06,673
Hey, hey, hey.

337
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,922
I would take a few more hours with you

338
00:21:08,947 --> 00:21:10,947
over forever without.

339
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,843
No, no, no.

340
00:21:13,868 --> 00:21:15,401
You can't do this.

341
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:18,848
I won't let you do this, so wake up.

342
00:21:18,873 --> 00:21:20,506
- Emori.
- Wake up.

343
00:21:20,642 --> 00:21:23,042
Just wake up! Wake up!

344
00:21:23,178 --> 00:21:25,051
Wake up! Wake up!

345
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:27,733
Jackson! Jackson, wake him up!

346
00:21:27,758 --> 00:21:29,726
- Emori.
- Don't let him do this.

347
00:21:29,861 --> 00:21:31,962
Jackson! John, John!

348
00:21:31,987 --> 00:21:34,340
- Stop, stop, hey.
- Don't! Let go of me!

349
00:21:34,365 --> 00:21:36,399
This is OK with me.

350
00:21:36,598 --> 00:21:40,270
- No. It's not OK with me.
- It's OK. It's OK.

351
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:43,828
What is that?

352
00:21:49,061 --> 00:21:50,471
What?

353
00:21:53,608 --> 00:21:55,251
The last time I asked you to dance,

354
00:21:55,276 --> 00:21:57,276
you stabbed me with a butcher knife.

355
00:22:00,391 --> 00:22:01,991
Relationships.

356
00:22:02,016 --> 00:22:03,382

371

Clarke?

372
00:22:58,475 --> 00:23:00,809
Oh, that can't be good.

373
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:05,044
What have I done?

374
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:06,443
Clarke, wait!

375
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,235
Did you take the test?

376
00:23:08,459 --> 00:23:11,126
Tell me what happened.

377
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:12,999
I failed.

378
00:23:13,697 --> 00:23:16,126
It should have been you, not me.

379
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:19,126
They should have picked you first.

380
00:23:19,561 --> 00:23:21,306
So that's it?

381
00:23:22,063 --> 00:23:24,330
We don't transcend?

382
00:23:25,433 --> 00:23:27,592
We're wiped out? It's over?

383
00:23:28,645 --> 00:23:30,812
Well, can we change their minds?

384
00:23:32,006 --> 00:23:33,814
I don't know.

385
00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:37,813
I need to be with Madi.
There's not much time.

386
00:23:37,838 --> 00:23:39,638
Clarke, wait!

387
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:00,499
Ah. Touching a pulsar.
What could go wrong?

388
00:24:13,014 --> 00:24:14,981
No way.

389
00:24:16,486 --> 00:24:18,553
Wait. Where's Earth?

390
00:24:19,697 --> 00:24:22,298
About 42 billion light years away.

391
00:24:30,994 --> 00:24:32,454
You read our thoughts

392
00:24:32,479 --> 00:24:34,538
and take the form of someone we love.

393
00:24:34,563 --> 00:24:35,884
Very good.

394
00:24:36,671 --> 00:24:38,971
Yours is an interesting choice.

395
00:24:39,217 --> 00:24:41,019
Not your real mother,

396
00:24:41,461 --> 00:24:44,358
yet her opinion of
you mattered even more.

397
00:24:45,724 --> 00:24:47,724
You fear her judgment.

398
00:24:47,749 --> 00:24:49,081
Am I here to talk about me?

399
00:24:49,106 --> 00:24:50,705
Why are you here?

400
00:24:50,952 --> 00:24:52,218
The test is over.

401
00:24:52,353 --> 00:24:53,730
As you know, Clarke failed.

402
00:24:53,755 --> 00:24:54,713
How can that be?

403
00:24:54,738 --> 00:24:57,890
Clarke sacrificed everything
for us so that we didn't have to.

404
00:24:58,026 --> 00:25:00,419
She gave up her soul
so we could keep ours.

405
00:25:00,444 --> 00:25:01,994
She committed atrocities.

406
00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:03,473
She was trying to save us.

407
00:25:03,498 --> 00:25:06,447
She doomed you. I'm sorry.

408
00:25:07,135 --> 00:25:08,812
Are you?

409
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,115
Because to me, it looks
like you don't feel anything.

410
00:25:12,251 --> 00:25:14,384
Have we made mistakes? Yes.

411
00:25:14,424 --> 00:25:16,098
Clarke, me, all of us,

412
00:25:16,123 --> 00:25:19,146
but we were just trying to survive.

413
00:25:19,955 --> 00:25:21,454
I'm not saying we're ready now,

414
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:24,320
and if you don't want
us to join you, fine...

415
00:25:25,787 --> 00:25:27,430
but at least let us live,

416
00:25:27,566 --> 00:25:28,906
keep trying to do better.

417
00:25:28,931 --> 00:25:31,267
We will. We have.

418
00:25:31,292 --> 00:25:33,215
You say you have,

419
00:25:34,636 --> 00:25:39,224
yet even now you are poised and
on the brink of self-extermination.

420
00:25:40,894 --> 00:25:42,394
Look.

421
00:25:51,644 --> 00:25:54,178
You say you're trying to do better,

422
00:25:54,624 --> 00:25:57,841
but all I see are two tribes
of frightened creatures

423
00:25:57,866 --> 00:26:00,820
willing to kill the
other to save themselves.

424
00:26:01,065 --> 00:26:02,598
But they're not fighting.

425
00:26:02,623 --> 00:26:04,367
It was just a distraction.

426
00:26:04,392 --> 00:26:06,358
This proves nothing.

427
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:10,174
They will fight, Raven,
like they always do.

428
00:26:10,199 --> 00:26:12,008
You can't possibly know that.

429
00:26:12,033 --> 00:26:13,532
Hmm.

430
00:26:17,881 --> 00:26:20,047
Let the games begin.

431
00:26:24,187 --> 00:26:26,076
Stop! What the hell are you doing?

432
00:26:26,101 --> 00:26:28,568
They can't see or hear you.

433
00:26:29,011 --> 00:26:31,048
You cannot stop this.

434
00:26:31,396 --> 00:26:32,963
No one can.

435
00:26:40,045 --> 00:26:42,858
Who fired? No one respond!

436
00:26:42,905 --> 00:26:44,842
Levitt, slow down!

437
00:26:45,277 --> 00:26:47,077
Hold your fire! Don't shoot!

438
00:26:47,157 --> 00:26:48,590
Hold!

439
00:26:48,615 --> 00:26:50,348
Wait, wait, wait!

440
00:26:55,612 --> 00:26:57,078
Hold!

441
00:26:57,563 --> 00:26:58,962
Listen to me.

442
00:26:58,996 --> 00:27:00,862
This is not the last war.

443
00:27:02,024 --> 00:27:05,149
We don't achieve
transcendence through violence.

444
00:27:05,262 --> 00:27:06,962
Cadogan was wrong.

445
00:27:07,137 --> 00:27:11,046
We're being tested right now, all of us.

446
00:27:11,071 --> 00:27:12,165
You were saying?

447
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,890
Put down your weapons!

448
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,472
Nonsense.

449
00:27:15,497 --> 00:27:17,373
History is written by the victors.

450
00:27:17,398 --> 00:27:18,965
Let's try this again.

451
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,888
Man down!

452
00:27:25,913 --> 00:27:27,680
Return fire!

453
00:27:29,736 --> 00:27:32,222
Levitt, no!

454
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,633
Octavia, wait!

455
00:27:40,115 --> 00:27:41,140
Damn it!

456
00:27:41,165 --> 00:27:42,928
Indra, cover me!

457
00:27:43,092 --> 00:27:45,012
Fire!

458
00:27:56,019 --> 00:27:57,585
Oh, my God.

459
00:28:17,841 --> 00:28:19,007
Echo, you're hit.

460
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:20,254
What the hell are you doing?

461
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:21,753
I lost Bellamy.

462
00:28:21,778 --> 00:28:23,691
I will not lose his sister.

463
00:28:33,646 --> 00:28:35,746
Don't you see?

464
00:28:36,137 --> 00:28:39,171
Despite the beauty that
humans are capable of,

465
00:28:39,196 --> 00:28:41,707
you can't break free from
the cycle of violence.

466
00:28:47,594 --> 00:28:50,148
Hi, baby. I'm here.

467
00:28:50,173 --> 00:28:51,606
Aunty O!

468
00:28:55,545 --> 00:28:57,078
You have to stop the war.

469
00:28:57,103 --> 00:28:58,869
- I got this.
- Stop the war.

470
00:28:59,053 --> 00:29:01,119
This is who you are.

471
00:29:01,318 --> 00:29:03,107
That's why you failed the test.

472
00:29:03,132 --> 00:29:05,806
I'm so sorry I failed you.

473
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:08,415
I failed everyone.

474
00:29:10,427 --> 00:29:12,394
It's time for us to go, Raven.

475
00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:14,896
The end of the human race is here.

476
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:21,102
You can do this.

477
00:29:26,376 --> 00:29:30,011
Jordan, Hope,
don't let them die.

478
00:29:30,147 --> 00:29:32,380
The dead don't transcend.

479
00:29:34,584 --> 00:29:35,933
You're gonna be OK.

480
00:29:42,082 --> 00:29:45,124
Indra! Indra, hold your fire!

481
00:29:51,925 --> 00:29:53,322
_

482
00:29:56,006 --> 00:29:59,507
Indra is not in command here!

483
00:29:59,643 --> 00:30:03,560
I am, and I say...

484
00:30:06,584 --> 00:30:10,099
_

485
00:30:18,941 --> 00:30:20,187
_

486
00:30:20,512 --> 00:30:22,115
_

487
00:30:22,742 --> 00:30:24,099
_

488
00:30:24,329 --> 00:30:25,464
_

489
00:30:27,639 --> 00:30:28,837
_

490
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:37,401
Enough!

491
00:30:43,701 --> 00:30:46,134
What the hell are we doing here?

492
00:30:46,191 --> 00:30:49,472
You swore an oath to
fight for all mankind.

493
00:30:51,788 --> 00:30:53,788
Well, look around you!

494
00:30:55,308 --> 00:30:58,679
We are mankind! We are one crew!

495
00:30:59,317 --> 00:31:00,983
If I kill you,

496
00:31:01,285 --> 00:31:03,051
I kill myself.

497
00:31:03,076 --> 00:31:04,694
If we keep killing each other,

498
00:31:04,719 --> 00:31:07,140
there won't be anyone left to save!

499
00:31:08,522 --> 00:31:11,222
Our fight is over, Indra!

500
00:31:36,483 --> 00:31:38,783
I hope you know what you're doing.

501
00:31:42,212 --> 00:31:43,978
We're unarmed.

502
00:31:44,114 --> 00:31:45,957
I know you're afraid to walk away

503
00:31:45,982 --> 00:31:48,299
from everything you've spent
your lives training for.

504
00:31:49,052 --> 00:31:51,452
I am, too.

505
00:31:51,588 --> 00:31:55,101
My brother believed, as you do,

506
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:59,081
that transcendence, whatever that means,

507
00:31:59,106 --> 00:32:00,990
is within reach.

508
00:32:01,015 --> 00:32:02,597
He died for that belief,

509
00:32:02,732 --> 00:32:04,990
and for that, he'll never get there,

510
00:32:05,602 --> 00:32:07,769
never transcend.

511
00:32:07,904 --> 00:32:09,862
I don't know what I believe,

512
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:12,509
but I do know that if we fight this war

513
00:32:12,534 --> 00:32:15,942
we don't deserve to
find out if he was right.

514
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,515
We don't deserve to survive.

515
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,843
We fail, we die.

516
00:32:24,914 --> 00:32:26,214
She's reaching them.

517
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:30,108
I've been to war, and let me tell you

518
00:32:30,607 --> 00:32:32,874
the only way to win...

519
00:32:34,587 --> 00:32:36,721
is not to fight.

520
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,570
Nice speech.

521
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:58,196
No. Stay with me!

522
00:32:58,221 --> 00:33:00,652
This does not end here.

523
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,868
Echo, no! No!

524
00:33:03,893 --> 00:33:06,406
Pump her heart. Do it now!

525
00:33:09,865 --> 00:33:11,798
Sir, what are your orders?

526
00:33:28,195 --> 00:33:29,928
For all mankind.

527
00:33:35,892 --> 00:33:37,892
For all mankind.

528
00:33:40,112 --> 00:33:42,146
- For all mankind.
- For all mankind.

529
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,523
For all mankind.

530
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:45,800
- For all mankind.
- For all mankind.

531
00:33:45,935 --> 00:33:49,270
I told you. We can change.

532
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,316
We just need more time.

533
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,497
Please.

534
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:01,512
- What are you doing?
- What?

535
00:34:01,536 --> 00:34:03,302
I said...

536
00:34:07,682 --> 00:34:09,449
What's happening?

537
00:34:21,204 --> 00:34:22,904
No pain.

538
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,880
Oh, my God.

539
00:34:34,742 --> 00:34:37,076
This is what I saw when I was adjusting.

540
00:34:50,029 --> 00:34:52,496
Bellamy was right.

541
00:35:17,492 --> 00:35:19,158
Jax.

542
00:35:20,725 --> 00:35:22,558
We're glowing.

543
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,486
Oh, now that is cool.

544
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,357
Raven went in.

545
00:35:58,701 --> 00:36:00,234
It's OK.

546
00:36:02,565 --> 00:36:05,366
I know you don't want to leave me...

547
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,709
but you have to go now.

548
00:36:11,447 --> 00:36:13,815
This gives you a chance to live.

549
00:36:16,029 --> 00:36:19,492
Let go, Madi. Just let go.

550
00:36:20,499 --> 00:36:22,404
I'll be OK.

551
00:36:39,316 --> 00:36:41,827
I love you forever, Madi,

552
00:36:43,264 --> 00:36:44,797
forever.

553
00:37:26,121 --> 00:37:29,055
Is anyone here?

554
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,181
Murphy?

555
00:37:31,481 --> 00:37:32,947
Emori?

556
00:37:47,778 --> 00:37:50,740
Hey, girl! Hi!

557
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:54,737
Where are we gonna live, girl, huh?

558
00:37:54,801 --> 00:37:57,802
Where are we gonna live?

559
00:38:27,526 --> 00:38:30,027
Today, water and shelter.

560
00:38:30,052 --> 00:38:32,353
Tomorrow, food, OK?

561
00:38:35,367 --> 00:38:37,683
Picasso, come!

562
00:38:38,288 --> 00:38:39,654
Damn it!

563
00:38:51,557 --> 00:38:52,856
Picasso?

564
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:57,959
Picasso?

565
00:39:05,362 --> 00:39:07,795
Picasso?

566
00:39:09,937 --> 00:39:11,974
Please come back!

567
00:39:12,749 --> 00:39:14,582
I don't want to be alone.

568
00:39:20,223 --> 00:39:22,423
I don't want to be alone.

569
00:39:24,635 --> 00:39:25,968
You're not.

570
00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:33,048
What do you want?

571
00:39:33,073 --> 00:39:35,006
To explain.

572
00:39:35,379 --> 00:39:37,613
There's no need.

573
00:39:37,963 --> 00:39:43,315
I get it. I bear it so
they don't have to again.

574
00:39:44,335 --> 00:39:47,069
Such a curious species.

575
00:39:47,126 --> 00:39:49,627
You've added so much to us already.

576
00:39:49,652 --> 00:39:51,786
I'm glad to have been wrong about you.

577
00:39:51,811 --> 00:39:53,408
Wait.

578
00:39:54,302 --> 00:39:55,843
Does that mean...

579
00:39:55,868 --> 00:39:57,464
you're here to take me with you?

580
00:39:57,489 --> 00:40:01,391
No. You can never join us, Clarke.

581
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:03,700
Your actions must have a cost.

582
00:40:03,811 --> 00:40:05,912
Just mine?

583
00:40:06,277 --> 00:40:09,812
Am I the only human
being who ever sinned?

584
00:40:09,938 --> 00:40:10,984
Of course not,

585
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:13,530
but you are the only test
subject from any species

586
00:40:13,555 --> 00:40:15,756
anywhere in the universe
since the dawn of time

587
00:40:15,781 --> 00:40:18,344
who committed murder during a test.

588
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:20,517
I'd do it again.

589
00:40:20,682 --> 00:40:22,628
Madi knew you'd say that.

590
00:40:24,418 --> 00:40:25,617
Madi's with you then?

591
00:40:25,642 --> 00:40:27,430
In a manner of speaking, yes.

592
00:40:27,516 --> 00:40:29,423
Her consciousness has joined ours.

593
00:40:29,448 --> 00:40:31,415
She's at peace.

594
00:40:31,665 --> 00:40:34,099
She'll never feel
pain, she'll never die.

595
00:40:34,282 --> 00:40:37,364
She knew that living here
without anyone her own age to love

596
00:40:37,389 --> 00:40:39,923
is something you wouldn't
have wanted for her,

597
00:40:40,031 --> 00:40:42,253
even if it meant you being alone.

598
00:40:42,669 --> 00:40:44,110
I suppose that choice was made easier

599
00:40:44,134 --> 00:40:47,094
with the realization you wouldn't be.

600
00:40:47,826 --> 00:40:50,360
Transcendence is a choice?

601
00:40:50,703 --> 00:40:52,082
You can choose to come back?

602
00:40:52,107 --> 00:40:53,570
Of course,

603
00:40:54,633 --> 00:40:57,118
though until now no one ever had.

604
00:41:03,372 --> 00:41:05,439
Wow! There's all these fish!

605
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:21,965
There won't be offspring,

606
00:41:22,101 --> 00:41:24,784
and they won't join us when they die.

607
00:41:26,906 --> 00:41:28,969
None of them seem to care.

608
00:41:30,217 --> 00:41:33,718
Hey. There she is.

609
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:35,120
Clarke.

610
00:41:40,446 --> 00:41:42,145
A curious species indeed.

611
00:41:55,303 --> 00:41:56,669
Picasso!

612
00:41:58,434 --> 00:42:00,634
There she is! Hi!
