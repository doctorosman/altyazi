1
00:00:37,535 --> 00:00:38,801
Almost there!

2
00:00:38,937 --> 00:00:40,970
Stay with us, Emori. Stay with us!

3
00:00:40,995 --> 00:00:44,017
Ok. Slow, slow. Murph.

4
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:45,641
I got it!

5
00:00:45,777 --> 00:00:47,543
Raven, get the defibrillator.

6
00:00:47,568 --> 00:00:49,082
- Where?
- There!

7
00:00:49,107 --> 00:00:50,337
Hey. Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

8
00:00:50,361 --> 00:00:51,916
Stay with me.

9
00:00:53,418 --> 00:00:55,151
- Good. Now...
- I know how.

10
00:00:55,182 --> 00:00:56,448
I've used one on myself.

11
00:00:56,688 --> 00:00:58,621
Jax, what can I do?

12
00:00:58,756 --> 00:01:00,256
Nothing yet.

13
00:01:02,512 --> 00:01:03,645
- OK.
- Set.

14
00:01:03,828 --> 00:01:04,894
Clear!

15
00:01:11,002 --> 00:01:12,034
Come on!

16
00:01:12,059 --> 00:01:13,536
One more time. Come on.

17
00:01:13,584 --> 00:01:14,884
Raven, clear!

18
00:01:26,484 --> 00:01:28,195
- Good job.
- Her pulse is weak.

19
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:29,685
She's lost too much blood.

20
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:32,922
- So we give her mine.
- Mine, too.

21
00:01:33,057 --> 00:01:34,535
Murphy's a Nightblood. You're not.

22
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:36,692
- Wha...
- Just go back for the others.

23
00:01:36,828 --> 00:01:38,438
I can't just leave her like this.

24
00:01:38,463 --> 00:01:40,602
Unless you've done abdominal
surgery on yourself, too,

25
00:01:40,627 --> 00:01:42,428
there's nothing more you can do.

26
00:01:42,453 --> 00:01:44,024
I'll get her stable,
then take out the bar.

27
00:01:44,048 --> 00:01:45,904
Raven, he's right.
They could be trapped.

28
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:46,928
You got to get them out.

29
00:01:46,953 --> 00:01:49,261
- Alone? How? I...
- I don't know.

30
00:01:49,286 --> 00:01:50,547
Never mind. I'll figure it out.

31
00:01:50,572 --> 00:01:51,920
Just...

32
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,404
just save her.

33
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:56,515
Hey.

34
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,790
Once our friends are safe,

35
00:01:58,815 --> 00:02:00,866
you have to go after Madi, OK?

36
00:02:00,891 --> 00:02:02,756
You have to stop Cadogan.

37
00:02:16,467 --> 00:02:17,693
Shepherd en route to bridge.

38
00:02:17,717 --> 00:02:19,217
All disciples, stay alert.

39
00:02:22,753 --> 00:02:24,205
The Shepherd's unit will be with him

40
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:25,762
guarding the door.

41
00:02:26,055 --> 00:02:27,688
Too bad for them.

42
00:02:30,815 --> 00:02:32,618
Grenades?

43
00:02:32,643 --> 00:02:35,103
So more killing, that's the answer?

44
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:38,419
It's what we do.

45
00:02:38,856 --> 00:02:41,054
Maybe we don't deserve to transcend.

46
00:03:01,092 --> 00:03:02,925
Cover me.

47
00:03:11,628 --> 00:03:13,394
We're too late.

48
00:03:36,225 --> 00:03:38,358
What took you so long?

49
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:44,437
Our pier.

50
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:47,089
I took you fishing here once.

51
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:48,959
Why only once?

52
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:50,592
You jumped in.

53
00:03:51,385 --> 00:03:53,952
Oh, I told you not to,

54
00:03:54,198 --> 00:03:55,931
but you didn't listen.

55
00:03:56,766 --> 00:03:58,523
You never listened.

56
00:04:00,772 --> 00:04:02,738
She took after her mother.

57
00:04:05,977 --> 00:04:07,309
You're not Callie.

58
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:10,274
No. This is who you chose.

59
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:14,155
We most often take the form of
the subject's greatest teacher

60
00:04:14,774 --> 00:04:17,520
or the source of their greatest failure.

61
00:04:17,655 --> 00:04:21,298
In the rare emotion-driven
species such as your own,

62
00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:23,659
it can be their greatest love.

63
00:04:23,795 --> 00:04:26,063
Seems you're faced
with all of the above.

64
00:04:27,544 --> 00:04:28,810
Are you God?

65
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:33,905
For our purposes, you may
consider me your judge.

66
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,273
My judge? So they were right.

67
00:04:37,408 --> 00:04:41,699
This is a trial, a test, not a war.

68
00:04:42,172 --> 00:04:43,504
Correct.

69
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:46,596
The last of your kind to
stand before us... Becca...

70
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,741
refused the test.

71
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:51,266
Tell me... Dad,

72
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:54,067
is the human race now ready to join us?

73
00:04:54,092 --> 00:04:56,659
Yes... we are ready.

74
00:04:56,738 --> 00:04:58,338
Excellent.

75
00:04:58,592 --> 00:05:00,692
Here's how it works. We talk,

76
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,406
I ask questions, you answer truthfully.

77
00:05:03,486 --> 00:05:05,787
If you do not, I will know it.

78
00:05:06,081 --> 00:05:08,198
If your answers are satisfactory,

79
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,615
your consciousness and that

80
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,547
of your entire species
will become one with ours.

81
00:05:12,572 --> 00:05:15,190
You will transcend your human
form and become infinite.

82
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:17,713
If you fail to earn
this evolutionary leap,

83
00:05:17,992 --> 00:05:19,659
you will be eliminated,

84
00:05:19,684 --> 00:05:21,516
turned to crystal the way the Bardoans

85
00:05:21,549 --> 00:05:24,386
and countless other
civilizations before them were.

86
00:05:24,522 --> 00:05:26,155
Sound good?

87
00:05:27,792 --> 00:05:30,359
The first question is about love.

88
00:05:30,582 --> 00:05:33,182
So few species are given this gift,

89
00:05:33,477 --> 00:05:36,707
yet you have attempted to erase
it in pursuit of this moment.

90
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:38,564
Why?

91
00:05:57,121 --> 00:05:58,721
Pencils down.

92
00:06:05,681 --> 00:06:06,933
My turn.

93
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,992
Get some water.

94
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:11,261
Sounds like they're getting closer.

95
00:06:18,098 --> 00:06:21,299
Gaia took the last of
the water on her hunt.

96
00:06:23,575 --> 00:06:25,408
I'll go to the river.

97
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:45,795
I hate waiting.

98
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,063
Done too much of it.

99
00:06:47,088 --> 00:06:48,988
Trust me, I know.

100
00:06:51,754 --> 00:06:54,460
But Octavia and Clarke can
take care of themselves.

101
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,755
Thank you.

102
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,159
That's what friends are for.

103
00:07:00,612 --> 00:07:02,278
Friends, huh?

104
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:16,726
Can... friends do this?

105
00:07:27,871 --> 00:07:29,854
Oh, they're back!

106
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:34,110
Form up! Attack on my orders!

107
00:07:43,732 --> 00:07:45,365
What the hell are you doing here?

108
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,358
Saving our asses again.

109
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:52,505
Thank you.

110
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:54,741
It's what Hatch would do.

111
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,733
- Stone's right through there.
- Copy that.

112
00:07:56,758 --> 00:07:57,834
The rest of you beat it

113
00:07:57,859 --> 00:07:59,714
unless you want a lung
full of pulverized bunker.

114
00:07:59,738 --> 00:08:03,002
Hey! We've got people down there.

115
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:07,216
So you do. Hear that, boys?

116
00:08:07,241 --> 00:08:09,022
- Yep.
- Set phasers to stun.

117
00:08:09,047 --> 00:08:10,272
You got it.

118
00:08:10,297 --> 00:08:12,559
It's not Jackson. He's fine.

119
00:08:12,584 --> 00:08:13,850
In Sanctum treating Emori.

120
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,184
Murphy's with them.

121
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:16,834
It's got to be Echo or Niylah then.

122
00:08:16,859 --> 00:08:17,922
Why not the others?

123
00:08:17,947 --> 00:08:19,213
There are no others.

124
00:08:19,238 --> 00:08:22,238
Gabriel's dead. Cadogan
has Madi on Bardo.

125
00:08:22,263 --> 00:08:24,254
Clarke and Octavia went to get her back.

126
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:26,439
They're to return for us
so we can help stop him.

127
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,030
Fire in the hole!

128
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:31,202
Then let's do that.

129
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:33,577
How? Cadogan will be
mobilizing his army for war.

130
00:08:33,602 --> 00:08:34,522
We got 10 people.

131
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,119
With Sheidheda dead, Wonkru will fight.

132
00:08:36,143 --> 00:08:37,920
- We go to Sanctum first.
- Fire in the hole.

133
00:08:37,945 --> 00:08:39,811
Wonkru will lose, Indra.

134
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:41,365
Miller's right.

135
00:08:41,613 --> 00:08:44,577
What we need is a
distraction, not a fight,

136
00:08:44,602 --> 00:08:47,884
a way to get a small team past
their army to kill Cadogan.

137
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:52,144
Energy weapons.

138
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,632
Their weapons require energy, too.

139
00:08:54,657 --> 00:08:58,070
Too bad we won't be able to
see what we're firing ours at.

140
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,975
Maybe we will.

141
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:04,031
Look what I found.

142
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,446
Hope!

143
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,574
More importantly, we're
through the collapse.

144
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:13,174
Good. Then let's go.

145
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:14,413
Wait. What about Gaia?

146
00:09:14,438 --> 00:09:16,833
I'm sorry. Clarke and Octavia
are in trouble on Bardo.

147
00:09:16,858 --> 00:09:18,157
Sounds familiar.

148
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,167
Indra, we can't wait for her.

149
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,779
Slow down. We still don't have a plan

150
00:09:20,803 --> 00:09:22,477
that doesn't end with all of us dead.

151
00:09:22,502 --> 00:09:25,636
Actually, I think Jordan was
just about to tell us one.

152
00:09:28,174 --> 00:09:30,445
This one would make my father proud.

153
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:46,911
For my first trick,

154
00:09:47,512 --> 00:09:49,863
I will make an army appear.

155
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,487
I'm offline. Weapons not responsive.

156
00:09:57,512 --> 00:09:59,502
- I've got nothing.
- None of us do.

157
00:10:02,448 --> 00:10:03,947
This is not the stone room.

158
00:10:03,972 --> 00:10:05,571
The distraction can still work.

159
00:10:05,634 --> 00:10:07,415
Insertion team, go now!

160
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,106
Copy that. Echo, lead the way.

161
00:10:09,131 --> 00:10:11,797
The rest of you, into the trees!

162
00:10:14,152 --> 00:10:16,102
The last war is here!

163
00:10:16,127 --> 00:10:17,491
Their weapons are down.

164
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:19,149
Why aren't they attacking?

165
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,678
Move, move, move, move!

166
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,703
Well, they're distracted.

167
00:10:37,728 --> 00:10:38,879
Yeah. Long enough for us to die.

168
00:10:38,903 --> 00:10:40,270
We all will die.

169
00:10:40,295 --> 00:10:42,012
When is out of our control.

170
00:10:42,037 --> 00:10:43,536
This is a good how.

171
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:50,517
She's as stable as she's
gonna get. It's time.

172
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:52,174
Jax.

173
00:10:56,034 --> 00:10:57,400
Thank God.

174
00:11:00,685 --> 00:11:01,922
Raven got you out?

175
00:11:01,947 --> 00:11:04,692
Yeah. She and Wonkru
just left for Bardo.

176
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:07,223
Without you?

177
00:11:07,248 --> 00:11:08,781
I'm not leaving you again.

178
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,595
Whatever happens next,
we stick together.

179
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:15,766
I am glad you are safe.

180
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,034
Now how about my reunion?

181
00:11:22,273 --> 00:11:23,594
What can I do?

182
00:11:23,619 --> 00:11:25,552
Help hold her steady
while I take this out.

183
00:11:25,877 --> 00:11:27,243
If she moves,

184
00:11:27,378 --> 00:11:28,766
it'll cause even more damage.

185
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,724
- You understand?
- Yeah.

186
00:11:32,489 --> 00:11:34,322
On 3.

187
00:11:34,586 --> 00:11:36,488
1...

188
00:11:36,681 --> 00:11:38,080
2...

189
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,222
3.

190
00:11:44,434 --> 00:11:45,608
Hey, hey!

191
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:48,723
Hey. Come on. Emori, Emori! Emori!

192
00:11:48,748 --> 00:11:49,847
She's bleeding out.

193
00:11:49,871 --> 00:11:51,543
I have to get in there
surgically and find the...

194
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:52,894
Hurry up!

195
00:11:55,513 --> 00:11:57,180
No, Emori!

196
00:12:00,162 --> 00:12:01,662
Adrenaline.

197
00:12:12,457 --> 00:12:13,990
What are you doing?

198
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,503
Do something! Come on! Do something!

199
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,195
You're a doctor! Please!

200
00:12:21,132 --> 00:12:22,798
No.

201
00:12:25,903 --> 00:12:27,503
No, no, no, no.

202
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:29,961
Hey, hey.

203
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,122
Emori. No.

204
00:12:33,645 --> 00:12:37,380
Emori, please. Emori, please.

205
00:13:06,673 --> 00:13:08,573
Take out her mind drive.

206
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:11,042
- Please.
- Please what?

207
00:13:11,177 --> 00:13:13,021
Put her mind in your head?

208
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:16,473
We know from Clarke and
Josephine how that ends.

209
00:13:16,677 --> 00:13:18,143
Fine.

210
00:13:19,586 --> 00:13:21,452
- I'll do it myself.
- Mur...

211
00:13:28,628 --> 00:13:30,428
If you died

212
00:13:30,531 --> 00:13:32,765
and I could see you again,

213
00:13:33,122 --> 00:13:35,055
I would do the same thing.

214
00:13:40,673 --> 00:13:42,540
I got this.

215
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:47,419
You do realize that if
Clarke can't stop the test

216
00:13:47,444 --> 00:13:49,395
then we are buying time for Wanheda

217
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,086
to be the witness for the human race.

218
00:13:53,144 --> 00:13:55,339
Can I ask you something?

219
00:13:56,337 --> 00:13:58,515
If she gets it done,

220
00:13:59,098 --> 00:14:01,132
will my brother transcend?

221
00:14:01,427 --> 00:14:06,006
No. Shepherd's passage, "Book of Bardo,"

222
00:14:06,031 --> 00:14:07,665
Chapter 1, Verse 6.

223
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,662
"Death is the end, my friend.

224
00:14:09,687 --> 00:14:11,998
Only the living shall transcend."

225
00:14:12,623 --> 00:14:14,790
Must have slept through that class.

226
00:14:19,145 --> 00:14:21,656
- What?
- If she does take the test,

227
00:14:21,681 --> 00:14:23,268
then today's the end.

228
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,917
Either way, transcendence
or extinction...

229
00:14:30,006 --> 00:14:32,284
I would have liked to
live a little first.

230
00:14:32,761 --> 00:14:34,252
Same.

231
00:14:35,419 --> 00:14:36,604
Sorry to interrupt.

232
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:38,195
Ohh!

233
00:14:42,602 --> 00:14:45,436
- What happened here?
- We did.

234
00:14:45,461 --> 00:14:47,056
Don't tell me Cadogan killed Madi.

235
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,491
Worse than killed her.

236
00:14:48,516 --> 00:14:50,264
Clarke went in after
him to stop the test.

237
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,330
- Went in?
- How do you know

238
00:14:51,354 --> 00:14:52,452
you weren't followed?

239
00:14:52,477 --> 00:14:53,949
Hey. You can relax.

240
00:14:53,974 --> 00:14:55,297
The disciples have their hands full

241
00:14:55,321 --> 00:14:56,465
with Wonkru right now.

242
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,295
What, you brought an army here?

243
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,119
They're not here to fight.

244
00:15:00,353 --> 00:15:02,063
It was a distraction to get us inside

245
00:15:02,088 --> 00:15:04,460
- so we can kill Cadogan.
- The disciples don't know that.

246
00:15:04,485 --> 00:15:06,524
If Clarke can't stop the test
to determine whether or not

247
00:15:06,548 --> 00:15:07,936
the human race deserves to transcend

248
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,938
while what's left of the
human race is fighting a war...

249
00:15:09,962 --> 00:15:12,063
- That would be bad.
- Worse than bad.

250
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:14,398
If we fail, the transcendents send Gem9.

251
00:15:14,644 --> 00:15:16,000
The spy understands.

252
00:15:16,025 --> 00:15:18,759
Look. I'm sorry for
what I did to you, OK?

253
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,103
I wasn't myself.

254
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,294
We'll make friends later.

255
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:23,111
Right now, we have to stop the war.

256
00:15:23,136 --> 00:15:24,568
Levitt, on me.

257
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:26,318
I'm going with them.

258
00:15:26,446 --> 00:15:28,679
Raven, get that bridge open.

259
00:15:34,973 --> 00:15:37,073
You don't see that every day.

260
00:15:46,144 --> 00:15:48,644
Why am I still here?

261
00:15:48,835 --> 00:15:50,701
You know why.

262
00:15:57,704 --> 00:15:59,270
Lexa.

263
00:16:08,955 --> 00:16:11,247
I'm not her, Clarke.

264
00:16:12,091 --> 00:16:13,858
I know.

265
00:16:23,413 --> 00:16:24,913
The test isn't over?

266
00:16:25,104 --> 00:16:29,545
No. I'm sorry. We can't stop
what's been set in motion.

267
00:16:30,176 --> 00:16:33,844
Your species must now
be judged through you.

268
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:42,923
This man was unarmed, no threat to you,

269
00:16:42,948 --> 00:16:44,583
yet you killed him.

270
00:16:46,168 --> 00:16:47,701
Why?

271
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,392
He killed my daughter.

272
00:16:54,487 --> 00:16:56,400
Is Madi dead?

273
00:16:57,281 --> 00:17:01,498
No, but she will be because of him.

274
00:17:02,371 --> 00:17:04,375
So your need for
revenge is more important

275
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,187
than the fate of the entire human race?

276
00:17:06,212 --> 00:17:10,381
It's not revenge. It's justice.

277
00:17:10,516 --> 00:17:12,082
Clarke...

278
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:16,066
_

279
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:21,106
_

280
00:17:22,528 --> 00:17:24,541
You don't know my pain.

281
00:17:24,566 --> 00:17:25,963
You're wrong.

282
00:17:25,988 --> 00:17:28,756
During the test, I
sense every part of you.

283
00:17:29,635 --> 00:17:31,569
I'm feeling your pain right now.

284
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:32,797
Really?

285
00:17:34,173 --> 00:17:38,027
Then feel me holding Lexa as she dies.

286
00:17:39,219 --> 00:17:42,964
Feel me seeing someone
else wear my mother's face.

287
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:48,764
Feel me murder my best friend

288
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:50,298
to save my child,

289
00:17:50,323 --> 00:17:52,990
only to have her die anyway.

290
00:17:54,126 --> 00:17:55,810
Feel that.

291
00:17:55,884 --> 00:17:57,350
You suffer

292
00:17:58,122 --> 00:18:00,151
and inflict suffering on others.

293
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:04,721
Pain begets pain. That's
not justice, Clarke.

294
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:09,073
You say you do these things
to protect your people,

295
00:18:09,098 --> 00:18:11,613
but you're all one... people.

296
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:15,193
That much Cadogan had right.

297
00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:19,772
He created a world without love

298
00:18:19,886 --> 00:18:21,486
to get to you.

299
00:18:21,787 --> 00:18:24,989
He killed my child to get to you.

300
00:18:25,235 --> 00:18:28,790
Have you ever considered
that you're the problem?

301
00:18:28,815 --> 00:18:31,703
How dare you judge me

302
00:18:32,493 --> 00:18:34,924
when you annihilate entire species

303
00:18:34,949 --> 00:18:37,568
because they don't
live up to your ideals?

304
00:18:37,813 --> 00:18:41,148
Have I pulled the lever
to commit genocide?

305
00:18:41,173 --> 00:18:43,274
Yes, I have.

306
00:18:44,755 --> 00:18:47,555
And did love make me do this?

307
00:18:47,699 --> 00:18:50,099
You're damn right it did!

308
00:18:52,496 --> 00:18:54,429
But what's your excuse?

309
00:18:54,563 --> 00:18:56,964
You play games with people

310
00:18:56,989 --> 00:18:59,984
and call yourselves higher beings.

311
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,827
You are no better than
the murderers I've killed,

312
00:19:05,248 --> 00:19:08,483
and you are no better than me!

313
00:19:09,535 --> 00:19:12,269
I am sorry for all you have lost.

314
00:19:12,357 --> 00:19:14,191
You've borne so much...

315
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:19,912
But if you are humanity,

316
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:22,759
then I'm afraid humanity is not worthy

317
00:19:22,784 --> 00:19:24,750
of taking the next step.

318
00:19:27,104 --> 00:19:28,937
It has been decided.

319
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:32,910
_

320
00:20:11,905 --> 00:20:14,072
I remember that.

321
00:20:15,752 --> 00:20:17,989
The place we first met.

322
00:20:18,586 --> 00:20:21,287
Love at first knife to throat.

323
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,559
Oh, you are so beautiful.

324
00:20:26,805 --> 00:20:29,272
John, where are we?

325
00:20:29,572 --> 00:20:32,565
Josephine called it the mindspace.

326
00:20:33,136 --> 00:20:35,525
If it were up to me, I would
have chosen our cave, but...

327
00:20:39,144 --> 00:20:40,675
I died.

328
00:20:41,813 --> 00:20:43,513
You did.

329
00:20:44,555 --> 00:20:46,389
Not acceptable.

330
00:20:48,563 --> 00:20:50,029
Hmm.

331
00:20:52,998 --> 00:20:55,431
You put my mind drive in your head.

332
00:20:56,719 --> 00:21:01,338
Two minds, one body. You'll die, too.

333
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,113
You have to take it out.

334
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:05,319
Without you, I'd just
be surviving, Emori.

335
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:07,210
- I wouldn't be living.
- No.

336
00:21:07,235 --> 00:21:09,495
Hey, hey, hey.

337
00:21:09,882 --> 00:21:11,744
I would take a few more hours with you

338
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:13,769
over forever without.

339
00:21:15,063 --> 00:21:16,719
No, no, no.

340
00:21:16,744 --> 00:21:18,277
You can't do this.

341
00:21:18,523 --> 00:21:21,724
I won't let you do this, so wake up.

342
00:21:21,749 --> 00:21:23,382
- Emori.
- Wake up.

343
00:21:23,518 --> 00:21:25,918
Just wake up! Wake up!

344
00:21:26,054 --> 00:21:27,927
Wake up! Wake up!

345
00:21:27,952 --> 00:21:30,609
Jackson! Jackson, wake him up!

346
00:21:30,634 --> 00:21:32,602
- Emori.
- Don't let him do this.

347
00:21:32,737 --> 00:21:34,838
Jackson! John, John!

348
00:21:34,863 --> 00:21:37,216
- Stop, stop, hey.
- Don't! Let go of me!

349
00:21:37,241 --> 00:21:39,275
This is OK with me.

350
00:21:39,474 --> 00:21:43,146
- No. It's not OK with me.
- It's OK. It's OK.

351
00:21:45,244 --> 00:21:46,704
What is that?

352
00:21:51,937 --> 00:21:53,347
What?

353
00:21:56,484 --> 00:21:58,127
The last time I asked you to dance,

354
00:21:58,152 --> 00:22:00,152
you stabbed me with a butcher knife.

355
00:22:03,267 --> 00:22:04,867
Relationships.

356
00:22:04,892 --> 00:22:06,258

371

Clarke?

372
00:23:01,351 --> 00:23:03,685
Oh, that can't be good.

373
00:23:05,486 --> 00:23:07,920
What have I done?

374
00:23:08,165 --> 00:23:09,319
Clarke, wait!

375
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:11,111
Did you take the test?

376
00:23:11,335 --> 00:23:14,002
Tell me what happened.

377
00:23:14,195 --> 00:23:15,875
I failed.

378
00:23:16,573 --> 00:23:19,002
It should have been you, not me.

379
00:23:19,835 --> 00:23:22,002
They should have picked you first.

380
00:23:22,437 --> 00:23:24,182
So that's it?

381
00:23:24,939 --> 00:23:27,206
We don't transcend?

382
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:30,468
We're wiped out? It's over?

383
00:23:31,521 --> 00:23:33,688
Well, can we change their minds?

384
00:23:34,882 --> 00:23:36,690
I don't know.

385
00:23:38,285 --> 00:23:40,689
I need to be with Madi.
There's not much time.

386
00:23:40,714 --> 00:23:42,514
Clarke, wait!

387
00:24:00,675 --> 00:24:03,375
Ah. Touching a pulsar.
What could go wrong?

388
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,857
No way.

389
00:24:19,362 --> 00:24:21,429
Wait. Where's Earth?

390
00:24:22,573 --> 00:24:25,174
About 42 billion light years away.

391
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,330
You read our thoughts

392
00:24:35,355 --> 00:24:37,414
and take the form of someone we love.

393
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:38,760
Very good.

394
00:24:39,547 --> 00:24:41,847
Yours is an interesting choice.

395
00:24:42,093 --> 00:24:43,895
Not your real mother,

396
00:24:44,337 --> 00:24:47,234
yet her opinion of
you mattered even more.

397
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,600
You fear her judgment.

398
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:51,957
Am I here to talk about me?

399
00:24:51,982 --> 00:24:53,581
Why are you here?

400
00:24:53,828 --> 00:24:55,094
The test is over.

401
00:24:55,229 --> 00:24:56,606
As you know, Clarke failed.

402
00:24:56,631 --> 00:24:57,589
How can that be?

403
00:24:57,614 --> 00:25:00,766
Clarke sacrificed everything
for us so that we didn't have to.

404
00:25:00,902 --> 00:25:03,295
She gave up her soul
so we could keep ours.

405
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,870
She committed atrocities.

406
00:25:04,895 --> 00:25:06,349
She was trying to save us.

407
00:25:06,374 --> 00:25:09,323
She doomed you. I'm sorry.

408
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:11,688
Are you?

409
00:25:12,586 --> 00:25:14,991
Because to me, it looks
like you don't feel anything.

410
00:25:15,127 --> 00:25:17,260
Have we made mistakes? Yes.

411
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,974
Clarke, me, all of us,

412
00:25:18,999 --> 00:25:22,022
but we were just trying to survive.

413
00:25:22,831 --> 00:25:24,330
I'm not saying we're ready now,

414
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:27,196
and if you don't want
us to join you, fine...

415
00:25:28,663 --> 00:25:30,306
but at least let us live,

416
00:25:30,442 --> 00:25:31,782
keep trying to do better.

417
00:25:31,807 --> 00:25:34,143
We will. We have.

418
00:25:34,168 --> 00:25:36,091
You say you have,

419
00:25:37,512 --> 00:25:42,100
yet even now you are poised and
on the brink of self-extermination.

420
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:45,270
Look.

421
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,054
You say you're trying to do better,

422
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,717
but all I see are two tribes
of frightened creatures

423
00:26:00,742 --> 00:26:03,696
willing to kill the
other to save themselves.

424
00:26:03,941 --> 00:26:05,474
But they're not fighting.

425
00:26:05,499 --> 00:26:07,243
It was just a distraction.

426
00:26:07,268 --> 00:26:09,234
This proves nothing.

427
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:13,050
They will fight, Raven,
like they always do.

428
00:26:13,075 --> 00:26:14,884
You can't possibly know that.

429
00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:16,408
Hmm.

430
00:26:20,757 --> 00:26:22,923
Let the games begin.

431
00:26:28,024 --> 00:26:29,913
Stop! What the hell are you doing?

432
00:26:29,938 --> 00:26:32,405
They can't see or hear you.

433
00:26:32,904 --> 00:26:34,941
You cannot stop this.

434
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:36,856
No one can.

435
00:26:43,938 --> 00:26:46,803
Who fired? No one respond!

436
00:26:46,828 --> 00:26:48,765
Levitt, slow down!

437
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,000
Hold your fire! Don't shoot!

438
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,513
Hold!

439
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:54,271
Wait, wait, wait!

440
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,001
Hold!

441
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:02,885
Listen to me.

442
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:04,785
This is not the last war.

443
00:27:05,947 --> 00:27:09,072
We don't achieve
transcendence through violence.

444
00:27:09,185 --> 00:27:10,885
Cadogan was wrong.

445
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:14,969
We're being tested right now, all of us.

446
00:27:14,994 --> 00:27:16,088
You were saying?

447
00:27:16,113 --> 00:27:17,813
Put down your weapons!

448
00:27:18,163 --> 00:27:19,395
Nonsense.

449
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,296
History is written by the victors.

450
00:27:21,321 --> 00:27:22,888
Let's try this again.

451
00:27:28,543 --> 00:27:29,811
Man down!

452
00:27:29,836 --> 00:27:31,603
Return fire!

453
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:36,145
Levitt, no!

454
00:27:41,123 --> 00:27:42,556
Octavia, wait!

455
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:45,063
Damn it!

456
00:27:45,088 --> 00:27:46,851
Indra, cover me!

457
00:27:47,015 --> 00:27:48,935
Fire!

458
00:27:59,942 --> 00:28:01,508
Oh, my God.

459
00:28:21,764 --> 00:28:22,930
Echo, you're hit.

460
00:28:22,955 --> 00:28:24,177
What the hell are you doing?

461
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,676
I lost Bellamy.

462
00:28:25,701 --> 00:28:27,614
I will not lose his sister.

463
00:28:37,569 --> 00:28:39,669
Don't you see?

464
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,094
Despite the beauty that
humans are capable of,

465
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:45,630
you can't break free from
the cycle of violence.

466
00:28:51,517 --> 00:28:54,071
Hi, baby. I'm here.

467
00:28:54,096 --> 00:28:55,529
Aunty O!

468
00:28:59,468 --> 00:29:01,001
You have to stop the war.

469
00:29:01,026 --> 00:29:02,792
- I got this.
- Stop the war.

470
00:29:02,976 --> 00:29:05,042
This is who you are.

471
00:29:05,241 --> 00:29:07,030
That's why you failed the test.

472
00:29:07,055 --> 00:29:09,729
I'm so sorry I failed you.

473
00:29:10,772 --> 00:29:12,338
I failed everyone.

474
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,317
It's time for us to go, Raven.

475
00:29:16,452 --> 00:29:18,819
The end of the human race is here.

476
00:29:23,192 --> 00:29:25,025
You can do this.

477
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:33,934
Jordan, Hope, don't let them die.

478
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,303
The dead don't transcend.

479
00:29:38,507 --> 00:29:39,856
You're gonna be OK.

480
00:29:46,005 --> 00:29:49,047
Indra! Indra, hold your fire!

481
00:29:55,848 --> 00:29:57,245
_

482
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:03,430
Indra is not in command here!

483
00:30:03,566 --> 00:30:07,483
I am, and I say...

484
00:30:10,507 --> 00:30:14,022
_

485
00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:24,110
_

486
00:30:24,435 --> 00:30:26,038
_

487
00:30:26,665 --> 00:30:28,022
_

488
00:30:28,252 --> 00:30:29,387
_

489
00:30:31,562 --> 00:30:32,760
_

490
00:30:39,324 --> 00:30:41,324
Enough!

491
00:30:47,624 --> 00:30:50,057
What the hell are we doing here?

492
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:53,395
You swore an oath to
fight for all mankind.

493
00:30:55,711 --> 00:30:57,711
Well, look around you!

494
00:30:59,231 --> 00:31:02,602
We are mankind! We are one crew!

495
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,906
If I kill you,

496
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:06,974
I kill myself.

497
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:08,617
If we keep killing each other,

498
00:31:08,642 --> 00:31:11,063
there won't be anyone left to save!

499
00:31:12,445 --> 00:31:15,145
Our fight is over, Indra!

500
00:31:40,406 --> 00:31:42,706
I hope you know what you're doing.

501
00:31:46,135 --> 00:31:47,901
We're unarmed.

502
00:31:48,037 --> 00:31:49,880
I know you're afraid to walk away

503
00:31:49,905 --> 00:31:52,222
from everything you've spent
your lives training for.

504
00:31:52,975 --> 00:31:55,375
I am, too.

505
00:31:55,511 --> 00:31:59,024
My brother believed, as you do,

506
00:31:59,823 --> 00:32:03,004
that transcendence, whatever that means,

507
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:04,913
is within reach.

508
00:32:04,938 --> 00:32:06,520
He died for that belief,

509
00:32:06,655 --> 00:32:08,913
and for that, he'll never get there,

510
00:32:09,525 --> 00:32:11,692
never transcend.

511
00:32:11,827 --> 00:32:13,785
I don't know what I believe,

512
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,432
but I do know that if we fight this war

513
00:32:16,457 --> 00:32:19,865
we don't deserve to
find out if he was right.

514
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:23,438
We don't deserve to survive.

515
00:32:23,463 --> 00:32:26,766
We fail, we die.

516
00:32:28,837 --> 00:32:30,137
She's reaching them.

517
00:32:30,162 --> 00:32:34,031
I've been to war, and let me tell you

518
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,797
the only way to win...

519
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,644
is not to fight.

520
00:32:56,727 --> 00:32:58,493
Nice speech.

521
00:33:00,381 --> 00:33:02,119
No. Stay with me!

522
00:33:02,144 --> 00:33:04,575
This does not end here.

523
00:33:06,282 --> 00:33:07,791
Echo, no! No!

524
00:33:07,816 --> 00:33:10,329
Pump her heart. Do it now!

525
00:33:13,788 --> 00:33:15,721
Sir, what are your orders?

526
00:33:32,118 --> 00:33:33,851
For all mankind.

527
00:33:39,815 --> 00:33:41,815
For all mankind.

528
00:33:44,035 --> 00:33:46,069
- For all mankind.
- For all mankind.

529
00:33:46,213 --> 00:33:47,446
For all mankind.

530
00:33:47,756 --> 00:33:49,723
- For all mankind.
- For all mankind.

531
00:33:49,858 --> 00:33:53,193
I told you. We can change.

532
00:33:53,273 --> 00:33:55,239
We just need more time.

533
00:33:55,413 --> 00:33:57,420
Please.

534
00:34:04,006 --> 00:34:05,435
- What are you doing?
- What?

535
00:34:05,459 --> 00:34:07,225
I said...

536
00:34:11,605 --> 00:34:13,372
What's happening?

537
00:34:25,127 --> 00:34:26,827
No pain.

538
00:34:33,003 --> 00:34:34,803
Oh, my God.

539
00:34:38,665 --> 00:34:40,999
This is what I saw when I was adjusting.

540
00:34:53,952 --> 00:34:56,419
Bellamy was right.

541
00:35:21,415 --> 00:35:23,081
Jax.

542
00:35:24,648 --> 00:35:26,481
We're glowing.

543
00:35:30,443 --> 00:35:32,409
Oh, now that is cool.

544
00:35:50,213 --> 00:35:52,280
Raven went in.

545
00:36:02,624 --> 00:36:04,157
It's OK.

546
00:36:06,488 --> 00:36:09,289
I know you don't want to leave me...

547
00:36:10,733 --> 00:36:12,632
but you have to go now.

548
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,738
This gives you a chance to live.

549
00:36:19,952 --> 00:36:23,415
Let go, Madi. Just let go.

550
00:36:24,422 --> 00:36:26,327
I'll be OK.

551
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:45,750
I love you forever, Madi,

552
00:36:47,187 --> 00:36:48,720
forever.

553
00:37:31,072 --> 00:37:34,006
Is anyone here?

554
00:37:34,031 --> 00:37:36,132
Murphy?

555
00:37:36,432 --> 00:37:37,898
Emori?

556
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:55,691
Hey, girl! Hi!

557
00:37:56,453 --> 00:37:59,688
Where are we gonna live, girl, huh?

558
00:37:59,752 --> 00:38:02,753
Where are we gonna live?

559
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:34,978
Today, water and shelter.

560
00:38:35,003 --> 00:38:37,304
Tomorrow, food, OK?

561
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,634
Picasso, come!

562
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,605
Damn it!

563
00:38:56,508 --> 00:38:57,807
Picasso?

564
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,910
Picasso?

565
00:39:10,313 --> 00:39:12,746
Picasso?

566
00:39:14,888 --> 00:39:16,925
Please come back!

567
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,533
I don't want to be alone.

568
00:39:25,174 --> 00:39:27,374
I don't want to be alone.

569
00:39:29,586 --> 00:39:30,919
You're not.

570
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,999
What do you want?

571
00:39:38,024 --> 00:39:39,957
To explain.

572
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:42,564
There's no need.

573
00:39:42,914 --> 00:39:48,266
I get it. I bear it so
they don't have to again.

574
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:52,020
Such a curious species.

575
00:39:52,077 --> 00:39:54,578
You've added so much to us already.

576
00:39:54,603 --> 00:39:56,737
I'm glad to have been wrong about you.

577
00:39:56,762 --> 00:39:58,359
Wait.

578
00:39:59,253 --> 00:40:00,794
Does that mean...

579
00:40:00,819 --> 00:40:02,415
you're here to take me with you?

580
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,342
No. You can never join us, Clarke.

581
00:40:06,518 --> 00:40:08,651
Your actions must have a cost.

582
00:40:08,762 --> 00:40:10,863
Just mine?

583
00:40:11,228 --> 00:40:14,763
Am I the only human
being who ever sinned?

584
00:40:14,889 --> 00:40:15,978
Of course not,

585
00:40:16,003 --> 00:40:18,529
but you are the only test
subject from any species

586
00:40:18,554 --> 00:40:20,707
anywhere in the universe
since the dawn of time

587
00:40:20,732 --> 00:40:23,295
who committed murder during a test.

588
00:40:24,202 --> 00:40:25,468
I'd do it again.

589
00:40:25,633 --> 00:40:27,579
Madi knew you'd say that.

590
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:30,568
Madi's with you then?

591
00:40:30,593 --> 00:40:32,381
In a manner of speaking, yes.

592
00:40:32,467 --> 00:40:34,374
Her consciousness has joined ours.

593
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:36,366
She's at peace.

594
00:40:36,616 --> 00:40:39,050
She'll never feel
pain, she'll never die.

595
00:40:39,233 --> 00:40:42,315
She knew that living here
without anyone her own age to love

596
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,874
is something you wouldn't
have wanted for her,

597
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:47,204
even if it meant you being alone.

598
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,061
I suppose that choice was made easier

599
00:40:49,085 --> 00:40:52,045
with the realization you wouldn't be.

600
00:40:52,777 --> 00:40:55,311
Transcendence is a choice?

601
00:40:55,654 --> 00:40:57,092
You can choose to come back?

602
00:40:57,117 --> 00:40:58,521
Of course,

603
00:40:59,658 --> 00:41:02,069
though until now no one ever had.

604
00:41:08,323 --> 00:41:10,390
Wow! There's all these fish!

605
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,916
There won't be offspring,

606
00:41:27,052 --> 00:41:29,735
and they won't join us when they die.

607
00:41:31,857 --> 00:41:33,920
None of them seem to care.

608
00:41:35,168 --> 00:41:38,669
Hey. There she is.

609
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,071
Clarke.

610
00:41:45,397 --> 00:41:47,096
A curious species indeed.

611
00:42:00,254 --> 00:42:01,620
Picasso!

612
00:42:03,385 --> 00:42:05,585
There she is! Hi!
